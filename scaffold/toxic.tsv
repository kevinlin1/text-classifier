False	Who ever said ‚Äúeverything that distinguishes the human line from the other great apes can be explained by a single event‚Äù? Certainly not me. All I‚Äôve been doing is reacting to other editors who continually say there are better explanations than the AAH to explain human evolution. Alright, but what are these explanations? Whenever I ask I get nothing. And of course the AAH is falsifiable. You're getting confused because it's never been falsified (unlike the savanna theory, which has, and which proves that broad evolutionary theories can be).
False	I don't know why you haven't seen them, but I assure you there are. I have a couple of friends who are new to wikipedia and I told them to post and they say that there's no way to edit it at all.   And it seems to me by your previous post that you're not acting in wikipedia's best interests simply because of my behavior on my own user page. I certainly hope that's not the case here, but that's how it looks.   Furthermore, I was unaware that I'm not allowed to edit the content on my own user page. The reason I've blanked my content on there is because Trueblood keeps asking me questions and is really pissing me off, and instead of giving him a personal attack, I've chosen to ignore him. Instead he is reverting my page. Well, now I know I'm not allowed to change the content on my page, but I figure you might want to warn him not to revert everything I do simply because he doesn't agree with it. Because his harassment and his following me around and reverting me is really beginning to piss me off.

Not a germane or encyclopedic subject, more of an age-old slow news day preoccupation, it's like sending a reporter out to the local pool to take photos of children on a hot day.

False	"""   Fullmetal Particle Man   Another Youtube video (located here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahNYobJ_gjQ ) that I noticed that ALSO happens to fit extremely well features Fullmetal Alchemist characters in the positions of the four men;  Edward Elric (aka Ed, aka the Fullmetal Alchemist) is cast as Particle Man, this being the most obvious joke/reference; he's extremely touchy about his height, him being almost/most likely the shortest man in the military and NEARLY the shortest main character  I think that his brother Alphonse's real body takes that distinguishment away, however). In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequences from the anime (among them, the line """"When he's underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead?"""" is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prosthetic limbs  which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the 'Fullmetal' Alchemist).  Colonel Roy Mustang (aka the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp?), he is constantly taking jabs at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed's height), though in one episode in the anime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer's permission)  Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the anime the then-Colonel hesitates (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the anime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the anime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man VS Triangle Man footage.  Major Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and anime the man proudly brandishes his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp?) as the tallest supporting character in the series) and power (he performs his particular brand of alchemy through the use of powerful punches  one scene in the anime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet propelled at high speed via the punch's force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . . . along with his penchant for posing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations  a lot of his many talents, from his alchemy to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way).  Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life  Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he's dated in either series, anime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line """"Triangle Man hates Person Man"""" is given even more meaning with this Youtube video. (Ironically, when the line """"Lives his life in a garbage can"""" comes up, it shows Roy Mustang's old residence back when he was obsessed with, if I remember correctly, human transmutation.)  Just thought I'd share this. 72.234.152.82  """

False	DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN. The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief. Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran. There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD!   Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.  Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

False	Sun-7 Chesterfield Series   Hi Falcadore, I've started an article on the Amaroo Park Sun-7 Chesterfield Series but have left blank 1972 and 1973 in the List of Winners table.

False	"""  Whilst Dr. Beck asked only that we take down the BDI-II, I still have to pay $4 a copy for the original BDI-I so I must assume that's under copyright and licence as well. I'm going to try and find some relevant bits from WP:C to justify (or not) removing the links. From what I can see the relevant text is here:  Linking to copyrighted works """"External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine."""" From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a """"portfolio"""" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP? If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good. After all it just produces a number, it's only useful in context. One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help . For instance, MoodGym is a site which allows users to self-administer cognitive behavioral strategies .

""""Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation"""" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:  1-  It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear.   2- Several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police.  Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:  3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as """"forging evidence"""": """"He [Gon√ßalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being.""""   4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine). In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).   It seems that the British  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:  5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking    6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing:   5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. """"The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her"""" Something made them change their minds?  The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has.

Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all ≈°tokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.  5. early Slavic studies (≈†ara≈ôik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.  6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years.   Virtually all Starƒçeviƒá's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starƒçeviƒá polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations. Sarcasm hurts-but, this is what the polemic is all about.          """

False	"""  Hi Btphelps - The most important thing in any article on a historical person, whether it is for Wikipedia or an old-fashioned encyclopedia, is accuracy. That accuracy goes beyond just the facts and dates that are presented, and goes on to include any photographic images that are purported to be the individual in question. Recently someone who signs off as OSMOND PHILLIPS has been adding a large group of what are clearly phony photos represented as Wild West historical figures to articles on Wyatt Earp, John Clum, Bat Masterson, Mysterious Dave Mather, Luke Short and Billy the Kid - among others. This OSMOND PHILLIPS cites Robert G. McCubbin, the noted Wild West photo authority and collector, as being someone similar to how this OSMOND PHILLIPS would like to be viewed. What makes this interesting is that my longtime friend Bob McCubbin would be the very first to tell you that the entire collection submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS, to various Wikipedia articles, are NOT the people they are represented as - without exception. Bob McCubbin allowed me to use a photo of Ben Thompson for a book of mine that was published back in 1982. Bob McCubbin also provided additional photos for my 2015 biography (co-authored with Chuck Parsons) The Notorious Luke Short: Sporting Man of the Wild West. OSMOND PHILIPS would like to portray me as someone who is not qualified to judge a phony photo alleged to be a figure from the Wild West. Well, those who are familiar with my non-fiction books and articles  know that I have had a  concurrent career as an artist - a portrait artist. These portraits are noted for their photographic realism. Examples of my portraits were given in my series """"Gunfighters of the Real West,"""" a series of 50 articles that appeared in Real West between January 1978 and December 1985. Other examples of my portrait work of Wild West figures (always based upon authenticated photos of Wild West figures) can be found in each of my seven books. The fact is that you don't have to be an esteemed photo collected, like Bob McCubbin, or a portrait artist/Wild West historian, like myself to identify these photos from OSMOND PHILLIPS as fakes. Anyone off the street should be able to do it - it each and every case - by being shown an authenticated photo of the Wild West person in question when placed side-by-side with one of the OSMOND PHILLIPS photos. So why does OSMOND PHILLIPS do this? I think that individual has provided the answer by claiming that they have some kind of TV show coming up on """"National Geographic and Discovery."""" You want to talk about a """"conflict of interest."""" This person isn't interested in promoting a accurate information (or photos) for Wikipedia - but is very interested in promoting a TV show, and undoubtedly sales of these fake photos to gullible buyers.  I think time will show which one of us has the best interest of Wikipedia at heart. On one side you have an individual peppering Wikipedia articles on Wild West figures with photos that have no provenance - beyond their unsupported say so. Most photos from that era of the photos that have been submitted bear a photographers imprint, or logo, along with the place that  the photo was taken. The photos submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS most likely have these logos with the photographers address - but don't expect to see them any time soon. On, my side you have a historian and artist who has authored books that have Forewords by noted Wild West historians such as Joseph G. Rosa, Leon Metz and Rick Miller. I have also co-authored a book with Robert K. DeArment (considered by many to be the greatest of all living Wild West historians) and, more recently, Chuck Parsons also a noted Wild West historian and author. I stand on my credentials. This happens to be my 40th year being involved in Wild West history. During that time my reputation for honest and accuracy has been a constant. On those occasions when I've found some errors in my earlier work, I have made every attempt to correct it. I stand on my record - and I use my real name ... which is probably something OSMOND PHILLIPS can't claim.  On a final note I am very disappointed it what just happened to my updates that were being written for the existing article on Billy the Kid. I spent a lot of time on this, trying to provide a lot of missing information that other historians and students of the subject would have benefited from. Well, someone decided to revert to a previous version which not only obliterated just about all of my work, but restored the phony photos by OSMOND PHILLIPS. I challenge anyone, particularly those with an interest in Billy the Kid, to take a look at my version (which was still a work in progress, that I was planning on getting to conform to the Wikipedia format and style) and compare it to what you have now. The person who reverted this claimed that my version was """"unreadable."""" I ask anyone, without an agenda,"

From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]  Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9]   From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books.   In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]  In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]
False	Nephilim deleted edit   You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter). This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage.  The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator.  Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be. The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall. This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy? You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public. Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in. The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it. Now you cam laugh and do a dance for you wasted my time and you have robbed the reader.

False	"""== Blood fetish == Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:  - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored. Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.  Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.      People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Œë‚áîŒ© ¬¶ ‚áí‚úâ)   It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.     Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda  I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Œë‚áîŒ© ¬¶ ‚áí‚úâ)  I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.     Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.     It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation.

False	I wanted to note that this only applies to 10^10^100. If googolplex means 10^(10^100), then it would be a completely different number. This is because what is inside the parenthesis needs to get evaluated first. In this case it would be 10^(1 followed by 100 zeroes). By using a little bit of mathematical induction you can conclude that it has a googol amount of zeroes. For instance, 10^7 has 7 zeroes, 10^10000 has 10000 zeroes, and therefore 10^(10^100) has 10^100 (googol amount of zeroes). But it seems like the article doesn't put the parenthesis.

False	There is a big difference between promotion and description. An encyclopedia should describe a subject objectively and neutrally. If it promotes an idea, it becomes an advertising tool, which Wikipedia shouldn't be. Describing consists of recounting facts. Promoting involves making subjective judgements about the facts and encouraging behavior. To include facts is not promotion, although doing so while leaving out other contradictory facts is biased, and can be considered promotional. So, the correct way to deal with pseudoscience (or any other article for that matter) is to describe the relevant, verifiable facts about the subject, whether positive or negative.  As for Lerner being notable, he could be considered notable on two separate subjects, his cosmology work and his fusion work. His cosmology work received more attention in the 90s, but he is still active in it today, and has received some media attention. His fusion work is more recent, and has received some media attention as listed in the references.

False	I found this article very easy to read and interesting. Article passes.
False	SBharris, I have just looked at both of your links. In both cases, contrary to what you say above, the derivation requires that the term  only applies in the limit. In the former paper (arXive) it occurs at equation (13). In the latter paper (J price) this is clearly stated in the last sentence of the wording beside fig. 5 on page 14 of the pdf file.  This means that the  term must be exclusively a tangential term. Hence the other v term in the Coriolis force must be a radial term. In other words, these transformation equations only apply to co-rotating radial motion such as would occur if an object were to be constrained to move in a radial groove on a rotating turntable.  As regards circular motion, it appears that both you and Brews are unfamiliar with planetary orbital theory. A circular motion occurs when the inward gravity force (centripetal force) always exactly cancels with the outward centrifugal force.  You both insist that a circular motion involves a net inward centripetal force. If that were so, the radius would shrink and we wouldn't have a circular motion.  You are basing your beliefs in this regard upon the restricted high school derivation of centripetal force in circular motion. The force needed to rotate the velocity vector inwards shows up to be the standard expression for centripetal force. However, if we examine the exact same vector diagram for a straight line motion measured relative to the same origin, we will obtain the exact same expression, only radially outwards. The centripetal force in circular motion is therefore merely cancelling with the centrifugal force. This fact is totally overlooked in high school physics courses.  You must never lose track of the physical meaning behind the maths symbols which you use. These transformation equations cannot be applied to a particle which is stationary in the inertial frame. The entire derivation of those equations is based on the actual components of its actual acceleration. One component leads to the Coriolis force and the other component leads to the centrifugal force. If there is no actual acceleration, then these two components will both be either zero, or equal and opposite. There will be no net inward centripetal force no matter what frame of reference we view it from.  As regards the merry-go-round example, it actually undermines your point and bolsters the very point that I have been trying to make. The quote The radial Coriolis force associated with azimuthal motion is much like an increase or slackening of the centrifugal force tends to confirm my view that the so-called radial Coriolis force is in fact a centrifugal force and that in meteorology it would invoke Archimedes' principle and invoke a torque on a cyclone, due to differential centrifugal force on the east-west wind at one side, and the west-east wind at the other side.

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down, removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments, a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an in-text link to the various articles on the regional tournaments. By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.  Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer.  I won't make any changes to the article unless other contributors think these ideas would improve it. I'd value your comments.

False	I did not revert TheOldJacobite's edits at all, you need to read the actual history properly and you'll note that he started all this by removing my new additional line entry and at no time did I remove any of TheOldJacobian's original page text, simply added to it. (Why hasn't he been similarly blocked for 3RR or is it just one rule for one and another for those with friends in Wikimadmin?  I added a fully policy-correct entry only to have TheOldJacobite arbitrarily remove it - and HE HAS (according to his discipline record) done this before. I, on the other hand, was simply adding a notable entry in accordance with what was required ... And yes I did read the WP:SONGCOVER. However, TheOldJacobite seems to think he owns this page and did everything to feed me incorrect information about policy - I checked and confirmed that he was making up clauses of policy that simply did not exist - and then tried to have me blocked and the page locked, a decision which Mark Arsten did not uphold. I'd like this matter now referred to Mark and an impartial review of the edit made again, as it would seem that your own blocking of my account on this is very one-sided and is, in itself, an arbitrary decision that needs to be referred to a higher authority within the Foundation. David Biddulph's referral for blocking is highly skewed as it does not include the background reasons for me having to protect my edit from the continual vandalistic behaviour of TheOldJacobite or Sjo. He, not surprisingly, skews the request by only mentioning 3RR and not requesting an impartial review of the entire matter. If that had been done properly, as per Wiki edit-warring policy, then a sanction against both parties should have been enforced. It is no wonder that new editors are leaving Wikipedia in droves when they are treated as inferior contributors and those editors who have a rather chequered past - TheOldJacobite's general behaviour is logged as public information - seems to be ignored as if their arbitrary an non-policy deletions are sacrosanct. I wonder if we'll see the matter referred to Mark Arsten as requested, or whether the appeal process is simply ignored. As this is a formal appeal, I understand that I can request the matter to be reviewed by another admin who did effect the block. Therefore please ask Mark Arsten to review the entire matter. Thank you. P.S. As the matter of taking on three editors, sometimes it takes people like me to stand up to gangs of bullies who are all simply taking personal actions against a newbie and wholly contradicting the very policies that they purport to uphold. I wonder if TheOldJacobite and Sjo are now deleting every unreferenced cover on the entire Wiki content, as it will take them about 60 years to do so.
False	An admin said to drop the matter and I didI stopped making comments on ANI.  However, I did make closing remarks to that admin's user talk page.  In retaliation, I am being punished.

False	I'm confused?  just had to type something tho to see what it's all about???
False	"""  Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: """"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment."""" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12.   Brunton's beginning point is that: """"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance.""""   I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is """"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"""" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The """"spiritual bypass"""" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ.   So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   """

And speaking of bad faith, you claimed you did not oppose redirecting to photo editing yet you blind reverted the change for no reason and left it that way even after the merge was complete AND you insisted upon trying to do more of a merge. Therefore your only so-called justification for the revert no longer holds true. If you want to demonstrate good faith instead of proving bad faith you should have undid your revert so that the article was redirected, per the consensus.

Happy editting/article writing  .   Should Joseph Baldwin Academy be nominated for AfD?   Hi William. Can you look at Joseph Baldwin Academy and see if you think it should be nominated for AfD? I can't establish any notability at all; no qualifying coverage at all. The article is about a summer program for kids that takes place at Truman State University. The whole thing simply looks like an advertisement or brochure for the program and all the sourcing is to the program's own website pages. The article even has the program's Summer 2012 schedule. Also, if you look at the talk page, the article has been written solely by their students as a project. If you think it should be nominated, can you start the AfD? I don't know how to do it.

Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners.

It was conquered by  Boleslaw I Chrobry, a duke of the western Polans, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire.

Generally speaking, a personal site isn't accepted as the only mark of somebody's notability.  A lot of people have personal sites, and they aren't notable for it.  The best thing to do would be to find a couple of other sources about Hammond, talking about his project, and link those; newspaper articles work, as do gallery notices and exhibit reviews.  If you have some kind of print source - an exhibition notice, or a catalogue with a bio - cite that as well.  It's not as easily checked, but it's usually a good mark of notability.  Hope this helps!

False	"""   A refutation of User:Lord Loxley   As soon as my ban expires, I shall revert the English people page to that which had been agreed by a consensus of editors, though I hope that someone else does so sooner. In the meantime, I shall attempt to address each of the issues raised by User:Lord Loxley's in his """"revisions"""".  In the """"related ethnic groups"""" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.  Further down the article you have inserted a sentence saying that the Tudors are the chief representative of the English kingdom. This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.  Still further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.  Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled """"Royalty"""", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab"

False	Since no one has answered this question, and I fall into the category you describe, I'll, ah...bite.  (I know, I knowsuch bad taste, ugh, but it's hard to not use these kinds of metaphors when talking about the subject.)  I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.

False	WP:WEB  I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture  Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.  As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:   Wikipedia:Verifiability  Wikipedia:Neutral point of view  Wikipedia:No original research  The following guidelines:   Wikipedia:Cite sources  Wikipedia:Reliable sources  And the following tests:   Wikipedia:Search engine test  Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites.

False	A reference of Jesus' cloak   Quote from the insight book:  The color of the cloak with which Jesus Christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the Bible record with reference to this garment. Matthew said that the soldiers ‚Äúdraped him with a scarlet cloak‚Äù (Mt 27:28), while Mark and John say that it was purple. (Mr 15:17; Joh 19:2) However, instead of being a discrepancy, such a variation in describing the garment‚Äôs color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the Gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion. Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment‚Äôs red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. ‚ÄúPurple‚Äù can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking Roman soldiers clothed Christ with on the last day of his human life.

U talk about this word about what other people use this word for , you really don't know what the word means.    there is a difference being a real martyr in the after life , vs a martyr (hero) in this life after you are dead or a fake one, a lie, not true one... i don't know how else to explain it.  does the truth mean anything to you, or is the intention of wikipedia's staff to confuse to world )

False	Dear Baba: Your words are wise. But I am sorry for not sharing your optimism. I prefer not to have my back to Muslims. My best Muslim friends turned against me once I told them I am out. They were not just ignorant Muslims but doctors and professors. Many of them subtly expressed their desire to see me dead, even though no one actually threatened me. I saw it wise to move to another country and keep my whereabouts guarded. I think I can do without Muslim cooperation and have little need for their friendship. They will stab their best friends in the back. I do not trust their smiles and offers of friendship. That is called Taqiyyah (the art of deception or what they term as ‚Äúdiplomacy‚Äù). That is their way to lull you into a false sense of security. Sorry BYT, nothing personal my friend. Once you leave Islam you will understand everything I say and I would love to sit and share our experiences while sipping our cold beers. I played that game of deception too without even thinking about it or being conscious of it. I too got involved into censoring facts about Islam just as Anonymous Editor so zealotry doing here. I wrote articles lying about Islam to present a false image of it, without even thinking this is dishonest. All notions of good and bad faded. All that mattered was da‚Äôwa. It was so natural to lie and all seemed so okay. I don‚Äôt dislike the Muslim converts here. I feel sympathy for them as I see myself in them. I hope that they too wake up and see the truth.

QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

I was not at all trying to """"own"""" the article, what I was trying is making sure that informed edits go through. In case you didn't notice, I previously asked for the article to be LOCKED for public editing, to lock out certain people (including myself!), to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits, while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refs/quoting. At the end of the day, I have given up now - and I won't bother wasting any more time debating things here, as usual, interest will degrade over time and some jackass-type personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later (probably the ones who just happen to be around accident-related articles because of recent news coverage) - at the moment, there's simply too much public interest, and what's happening isn't just a wp-specific issue, there's lots of layman's discussion taking place everywhere, without really adding to the quality of discussion. Finally, what's been happening here wouldn't be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors, where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals, encyclopedic or not. Again, this is nothing personal and against anybody here - I do realize that there are team dynamics at work here, and I have seen tons of editing wars going on here, not just due to my own edits - so I really don't take it personally.

Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information: Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered Multi-Licensing Guide  To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:  Option 1 I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below: {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} OR Option 2 I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below: {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}  Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".

But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?  BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?  Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?  I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.  Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.  Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.  Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?  The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?  The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.  To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.  Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?  Personal life  Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]  Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot Jos√© Mart√≠, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with Jos√© Mart√≠ as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Mart√≠ who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.  Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.  Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.  Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood"

False	If the relevant authorities did in fact, designate the organization as terrorist, then or now, that designation might well be significant enough to be in the lede. No agency did that at the time because the conception of terrorism was different in their day than now, and none is likely to do so now because there is no agency charged with making retrospective historical judgments. The history editor from the FBI's website communications department is not the one to make such an announcement. This article does face this stuff regularly, so the editors who have watched it for a while do not have a very high patience level for shenanigans. That's not ownership, that's taking the encyclopedia seriously instead of letting political sentiment color things. -

False	, 24 January 2010 (UTC) Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15

False	November 2005 (UTC)  Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.    Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30

False	"""  That helped a lot, thanks. The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it. I'am not using that as an excuse, but you know, its just surprising(and suspicious) the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles.

False	Hey, kicking the hornets nest happens, no fault of your own.  Let me just give you fair warning though, that the editor who initiated the move request has a long involvement in this, and all those folks that are supporting this move along side you are the native German speakers who were adamant against any form of compromise.  A bit weird they all show up within a couple days, isn't it?  LOL  The editor who made this move request regularly communicates offsite through e-mail, hence my suspicions.  Anyway, you'd think people could compromise, wouldn't you?  I guess history tells us that some humans are not capable of compromise...  So, anyway, as far as your research, and I'm not sure where you are based, but if you are in the United States, try dropping by a Whole Foods, etc.. and you'll see that products from this region are labeled as coming from Alto Adige.   This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.  So, I don't doubt that your intentions are genuine Dohn joe.  Be wary of what is going on here though...

Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that G√∂ran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply G√∂ran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. G√∂ran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.  Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm. Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornv√§nnen and has taken active part in the Helg√∂ project since the 1960s. Fornv√§nnen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornv√§nnen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson. Fornv√§nnen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesf√∂reningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens M√•nadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornv√§nnen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version. Fornv√§nnen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS.

False	This is about the Byzantium section, not the whole article, if you can get your mind around that idea, we are making progress. Again I repeat No one is claiming:  Byzantiums invented the symbol. Byzantiums are the only ones to use the symbol. Mehmet II and the Ottomans definately copied the flag.  So there is no need to drown the small section in repeated attempts to show that a turk at some point passed through a nation that had used the symbol at some point as a hopeless counter.  What is being claimed:  The flag of Byzantium, crescent moon and star was flying over Byzantium when as the Turks arrived to lay siege. Byzantium was the first state to use the symbols as national state symbols.  The fact that symbol is old has nothing to do with the Byzantium theory. It is about how the Turks came to adopt the symbol, not who invented it.  It is already stated  above (please read this carefully, i will repeat) It is already stated that the symbol has ancient roots above the section on Byzantium.  What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism, but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS, the Turks borrowed the symbols. Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged, the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums.  This however is obviously criptic to you and I am sure you will repeat your line about how Turks traveled through Babylon as some bizarre hope that it is relevant under this specific Byzantium section. The board of mediation will have to look at this I am afraid.

Also, when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did. So he's irish until proven otherwise. Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so.

False	"""   Solution   This is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.  Now, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):  1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution.   2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized.   3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.  4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.  5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.  6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes.   7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.  8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.  9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with.   10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.  11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.  RELATED ISSUES:  1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some """"Expert"""" to fix a Wikipedia article.   2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers.   3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice.

False	"""  Space disposal I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal.

False	"""   I need an advocate and help with mediation   Greetings,  I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.  I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.  I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.  I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.  Advantages of MWI  If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:  1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""  2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""  3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""  4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.  5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""  6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""  7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.  It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

False	I think you should rest for a while from WP, take a vac, it would be useful for you.
False	Yes, I'm sure, odd at it seems. Millar is mentioned, along with the Derby in several good sources other than the Willis West one I used in the article. The best source would be: A Thousand Blunders: The History of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in Northern British Columbia by Frank Leonard. I have it lent out right now, but I'll cite it in the article once I get it back and can put in the page numbers. And another source is Prince George, Rivers, Railways and Timber by Bev Christensen. I'm sure he's also mentioned in History of Prince George by Runnalls as well. Millar was a big part of our history and a large subdivision here carries his name. He was somewhat of a land speculator, and he very nearly owned Prince George. He tried to buy the land right out from under the GTP's nose, as they were footdragging, as they often did. Anyway, the GTP and Millar quarreled for years over the townsite and bridges and their rival sternwheelers. But the histories are clear that it's the same man, a Toronto lawyer and all that.
True	He doesn't consider this vandalism except when it's *his* talk page. Bullshit.

False	Warning templates on other's reverts   Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.  Incidentally, I sometimes get edit conflicts on a perp's Talk page from an editor warning on a different instance of vandalism (sometimes even to the same page) some of them crank out the garbage edits at an amazing rate.  Anyway, sorry if it puzzled you.   | Talk

False	In 1988 a Wide Use Campaign was introduced by republican senator, Mark Hatfield. The Wide Use Campaign supported unrestricted access to timber and other resources. Wise Use activists exploited the population‚Äôs fear of job and property security loss. The Campaign placed a barrier between workers and environmentalists. The Wide Use Campaign used bumper stickers, phone-ins and faxes to promote their views. Wise Use and Republicans kicked off anti-environmentalism. The recession that began in 1990 enhanced anti-green and pro-industry views. A group called Alliance for America was created with 125 anti-environment and pro-industry groups. In 1994, the US did not pass a Biodiversity Treaty.  Another group that was created in the 90‚Äôs was called Earth Day Alternatives. They were also counter-environmentalists. This group labelled environmentalists as ‚Äúanti-human‚Äù and extremists.  The Earth Day Alternative group promoted three things. They aimed to privatise resources for exploitation, advocate pollution to be permitted as trade between companies, to discredit environmental science. Heritage was a group that was also created with a laissez-faire approach toward the environment.  Anti-environmentalists were motivated by the fact that the ICI created deceptive green advertising.

False	Moving details below I think the details regarding the official reason provided by Israel from banning him from Israel should be moved to the section below, per WP:UNDUE. It is sufficiently notable to be mentioned in the introduction, in a slightly shorter form, only because it inhibits his humanitarian work in Palestine (for which he is known), but in itself being banned from entering Israel by the far right government there is not taken seriously anywhere else in the world, as they routinely ban academics or Nobel laureates who criticize them as well. I have no problem with including the fact that Israel says the reason was contact with Hamas leaders below (which is hardly considered a very strong or sensational accusation, as they are the governing party there and considering the fact that Norwegian conservative politicians also have meetings with Hamas, and having contact with Hamas is hardly considered any more controversial than meeting their Israeli counterparts in the Israeli government).

False	Fraudulent Law Degree   It should be fair commentary to note facts in the articles already referenced concerning the REASON Judge Ware told the fabricated story to hundreds of audiences over a twenty-year period after law school.  The reason cited in all of these articles is that this fabricated story is what motivated him to pursue a law career.  Therefore, it is also fair commentary to question whether this same fabrication that he told for 20 years after law school was part of Judge Ware's personal statement in his application to Stanford Law School, as anyone who has ever applied to law school knows that what motivates you to pursue a law career is the CENTRAL QUESTION in one's personal statement.  The lack of a more thorough investigation into whether Judge Ware told the same fabrication in his personal statement to law school is a CRITICAL ITEM that should be part of the commentary, as it is more likely than not that he did tell the same fabricated story, which would make his law degree fraudulent subjecting him to immediate disbarment.  Obviously, those who would know that this fabrication was on his personal statement would have complete power over this judge's career, making him incapable of delivering justice in particular cases if those with power over him want a different result.

However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space.

This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible.

Can you briefly mention your views and if possible give us some references, so that we can examine them?  It is the view of the prominent scholars that these were indeed composed in the Punjab region. When I say 'Punjab region' I don't necessarily mean the Indian state of Punjab, which is just a small part of former Punjab.  Internal evidence from these books leads us to the same conclusion that they they were indeed composed in this region.  The article Hinduism in Punjab is still evolving. However you can see a hint of the historical information that is avaialble to us.   Let us work together to make these article more informative to all.  Please do let us know in some detail of what you are looking for, and what perceptions we need to address.  Yours

False	"""  Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   """

That is because the arts are designed, used, mastered, and needed by men and its techniques are supposed to play to the strengths of a man. A woman's training dating back centuries was an emphasis on wounding the target with a basic attack and running. This is one of the many reasons escorts where provided. It is sad what has happened to Karate and TKD in the modern schools on average in the emphasis on sport and money from children practioners(by way of parent(s), unconditioned elders, and women.

It is the opposite sex that helps you compensate for your weaknesses due to your gender.

False	"""  The focus of the animation is the CMYK model, which is a mathematical abstraction, and not the device dependency of any particular print process. I consider it helpful in the same way as the animations at the articles RGB color space and YCbCr are in explaining a 3-D volume that can be difficult to visualize from a static drawing.  We cannot show subtractive ink colors accurately but that does not mean the article cannot have diagrams. The colors I used are the same as here and here i.e. 125 colors uniformly filling the displayable range and mapped to the CMK space. Note: this is not perfect, there is no gamma correction and linearity is assumed. If anyone likes to propose a different colour law in terms of 24-bit RGB shades, I can see about putting them in the animation.  Just noticing that it is a spinning object tells the viewer it is something in 3-D. It helps to notice that the cube rotates about its diagonal which is the K axis. Then one understands the geometry.  The goal is to give a qualitative visualization of how ink densities are coordinated like dimensions of a space. a) In principle three inks can define the whole gamut which is therefore a cube. The article explains that black ink is added to """"save money on ink"""" and to address the inadequacy of affordable CMK inks in very dark tones.  I think it is a forlorn expectation that any Wikipedia diagram can provide colorimetrically accurate color swatches. It is correct to show that the CMK trio of subtractive inks work, to a good first approximation, as orthogonal variables that define a color space.  jacobolus has ideas for further geometric diagrams of the printing process that should be helpful if they are based on reliable sources.

False	"""  Hi, n2e. It's great to have someone with an econ background looking at the Suburban Express article. You've proposed some sensible changes. But, as you can see, CorpM has a very strong point of view. The Suburban Express story is about a 19 year old kid who attacked incumbent Greyhound, decreased fares, increased frequency, and decreased travel times and then weathered attacks based on regulatory capture, predatory pricing, and (not covered in any press) harrassment by the Chicago Transit Authority, which leased space to Greyhound. It is novel in that S.E. sidestepped economic regulation which was designed to ensure legacy carriers (greyhound, et al) a fair return on their investment but which had morphed into a system that supported inefficiency, high fares, and lousy service. Since you teach, I imagine you can appreciate the issues we have with students trying to get what they want, regardless of the agreement they have with us.   e have battled all sorts of fraud during the course of our history - people making fake tickets, tons of bad checks, people passing their receipt out the bathroom window to a friend who then tells driver he is getting back on, and so forth. Fraud has lead to collection action of various forms, and it recently got some negative press because a small handful of nasty little assholes decided to devote their lives to trashing us. Their actions have not impacted ridership, but they have frustrated my employees and I by trashing us online wherever they get the chance. My instincts tell me that the user who is most committed to injecting POV into the article was contacted by one of the haters, who works in PR for the university and has contacts in that world.   The supposed """"controversy"""" is a mish-mash of different issues that the haters are promoting, all rolled into one: 1) we filed 100ish small claims suits in a short period of time. the number was unusual because we had about a 2 year backlog of debts to collect; 2) A subcontracted driver was rude to a student who does not speak english. He was promptly reprimanded and we sought to apologize to the passenger, but did not succeed in identifying her. A loudmouth narcissistic attention seeking student who was on the bus posted the story to facebook from the bus and spent every waking moment posting the story everywhere he could. 3) This led to a situation on Reddit where the loudmouth and his friends were trashing S.E. as best they could and the moderator started manipulating the conversation, by deleting comments made in support of S.E. That got out of hand and our attorney sent a demand letter to the moderator. The moderator then exploited free-speech bloggers and caused the BIG STORY to spread. Self-interest came into play - Reddit is owned by conde nast. Reddit benefits from awareness of reddit. Reddit can only exist if users are free to say whatever they want. Conde Nast also owns Ars Technica. Ars Technica wrote several blog posts about how horrible SE is for trying to suppress free speech on reddit. See how this works? Downstream lower-quality blogs regurgitated the free-speech story.  Two of the haters, now armed with SOURCES, took to Wikipedia and transformed this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suburban_Express&oldid;=542659074 into a very skewed mess. Then the problem became recursive - bloggers mentioned wikipedia, which led readers to trash the wikipedia page even more. Wiki editors cited the articles that cited wikipedia and the list of blogs that had covered the matter grew and grew.

If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~     In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Papp√©. In his article, Papp√© had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167‚Äì68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:  The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Papp√©'s book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p.¬†23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article‚Äî""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August‚ÄìSeptember 1937, p.¬†220.""""  Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Papp√©'s article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place."""""""

Seems like the former based on your response. Again, this link is a perfectly acceptable addition to the sites it was posted on  both because of subject matter and pursuant to Wikipedia rules.

False	"""   be with you.]]  The Force is something that makes others do things and stuff float at our command. It was discovered by George Lucas and revealed in his seven-and-two-thirds-part documentary Star Wars. Mark Hamill can use it, but Harrison Ford cannot. Not even while canoeing a fjord.  The Force and Religion In the essential melodrama of Force-wielding, George Lucas uncovers the struggle of Light vs. Dark in his aforementioned documentary Star Wars. During the filming, Lucas resided with and studied a small group of Jedi, Catholic monks who police and protect the Galaxy in accordance with the Gospel description of Jesus' work. We learn early that the Jedi manipulate small bits of The Force by controlling ther emotion, waving their hands around in odd and nondescript ways, and moving junk around via telepathy.  Soon, we encounter the Sith, pimps of the Galaxy who use the Dark Side of the Force for to fulfill their passions for beer and hookers, gambling, and unlimited power. The Dark Side, of course, is a double-edge sword, or more accurately, a red lightpaper: it can cut the shit outta yo hands unless you hold it the right way.  It is for this reason that many Sith have met their untimely demise falling down shafts and electrocuting things as their dead ass falls.  The Force and the Jedi Order Jedi training in the Presbyterian faith under Britney Spears (an anagram of Presbyterians) is a strenous and ancient ritual.  Boys and girls who show marked skills with the Force are granted training at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they learn Jedi skills, included amongst the many: lightsaber fighting, moving stuff with your mind, and convincing people these aren't the droids they're looking for.  While spending a number of years getting shot by remote droids, young Jedis in training learn about Jesus and his works, and the apostles, who were the first Jedi.    The Jedi Order has come under some severe scrutiny since a number of Padawan molestation cases during training in the Outer Rim territories.  Cardinal Yoda remains pensive.  The earliest recording of The Force is when Moses crossed the Delaware.  The second most Holy day of the Jedi Order is May 4th, colloquially recognized as 'May the 4th Be With You' day. The first most Holy day is Hannukah.  The Force and the Sith Lordth Many religious scholars blame the Sith, or the Jews, either way, for the murder and crucifiction of Jesus after Jesus balanced the Force.  However, many agree, except for those fascist scholarly types, that the Sith did not murder Jesus for religious reasons, but instead stood in the way to the creation of The First Galactic Empire as ruled by, then, Pope John Paul II.  In the modern era, Many Sith were converted by door-to-door Force-marketers, a practice which is currently being aprised by the Supreme Court. If people choose not to convert to the Sith, the Sith use the Dark side to throw barrels, pipes, man hole covers, and freight trains through people's front windows or trap them in Force-fields until they can be used to make a rather fuckish shade of Soylent Green.  The Force and Race An often-used explanation of The Force consists of Light and Dark sides of a spectrum, or, in computing terms, 256-bit values of RGB locked together. In this analogy, the Force draws upon the age-old battle of 'The White Man Repressin' against 'Nigger Stole my bike.'  """"Paradise Losticus,"""" of ancient, unknown authoring, is the most vivid and accurate account of the religious turmoil within the Force. In the climactic ending of the book, Sith Lord Darth Maul returns Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's bike.  The Light and Dark sides cannot coexist side-by-side, not even in Detroit.  Bickering on both sides has sparked off many Holy Wars, like the Crusades and as detailed in the six part documentary Star Wars.  The Light Side has come under significant fire in mordern times, despite its true purpose of """"Guarding of Peace and Justice."""" Many believe, probably due to Sith indoctrination, that this could just be bullshit for """"Defenders of Big Business and the Oil Industry.""""  This could explain why the Jedi Temple is on the wildly industrialized planet Coruscant, and the Sith live in ghettos like Cleveland.  It is wholly undisputed that the Dark Side of the Force repre"

Given that the article claims that this group have been classified as a proscribed terrorist group in the United Kingdom and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland then it is very relevant to the LEDE to show what this means in human terms. It would be an emotional bias if they mentioned animals killed but I think we can live with just listing a round figure of humans injured and killed with further detail on exact body-counts in the main text.

False	Blaming infidelity for homosexuality   She met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy was devastated by the infidelity and blamed it for his change in sexual orientation. He adopted a gay lifestyle, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and he and McCracken were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984.  I'm skeptical of the statement that Dunphy simply chose to be gay after the affair.  This sounds like sneaky POV pushing.  For the most part, the consensus is that people are born gay, they don't choose it.

False	"""   Drug abuse   """"Before I attempt to do a major revision on this article, I would like to get your opinion on the title. I notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction, so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article? It seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse, and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction. What do you think? If you disagree, in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go, and what topics do you think it should focus upon? I was thinking it could examine the scientific, poltical, and social aspects."""" -Viriditas  I believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article (which is a redirection to recreational drug use).  It could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted NPOV term, and having appropriate redirects.  I agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article, but then such an article (substance abuse) should also include information on alcohol abuse, which currently has its own page as alcoholism.  The drug addiction page has some POV problems.  What should be done here is to leave 'drug addiction' itself under the domain of Addiction, and rename the drug addiction page (with all its references to brain chemistry, and method of action) to Drug dependence.  Anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page.  I'm more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper NPOV naming (even if they are stub articles) as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages.  My vote would be to make substance abuse it's own page talking about substance abuse in general, and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances (i.e. alcoholism).  Specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages.  I'm certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages.  I'm certain that some will be opposed to separating the """"good and the bad"""" of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages (consider Alcohol > Alcoholic beverage > Alcoholism), but if alcohol is treated that way, then other substances deserve the same consideration.  If people disagree, then I'd argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined.   23:23, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)"""

(Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.  The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.  So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.  Edits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): """"Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead"""" - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use"

False	"""  It says to use secondary sources primarily, not exclusively.  Besides it being a rather obvious, observable fact that the new street lights are brighter, we have a reference in that they were claimed to be 'safer' (i.e., provide more light).   The fact that light pollution is increased with increased brightness is non-arguable, it'd be like saying you have to prove the sun is generally brighter at mid-day. Light pollution has to do with the amount of light used. Newer street light technology produces more light with less energy. The less energy part is great, it's the more light that has to do with light pollution.  How's this: In 2011, the City announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to """"make our neighborhoods safer"""" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability]. Wikipedia. Retrieved February 7, 2014.  In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an """"intelligent"""" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[38]  ..(Side Note) I found several non-local references while searching for 'street lights controversy', one claimed a battle was 'raging' in communities across the nation, in places that were making the switch to brighter street lighting. It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it).

False	From Nuclear explosion: In 1945 there was some initial speculation among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons that there might be a possibility of igniting the earth's atmosphere with a large enough nuclear explosion. This would concern a nuclear reaction of two nitrogen atoms forming a carbon and an oxygen atom, with release of energy. This energy would heat up the remaining nitrogen enough to keep the reaction going until all nitrogen were finished. This was, however, quickly shown to be unlikely enough to be considered impossible . Nevertheless, the notion has persisted as a rumor for many years.

I developed all the hardware and did the fabrication myself.  Later a school in Wayne, PA was set up with a similar installation.  Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.   John Feagans Ele'ele, Hi.  """

False	"""   [edit conflict]   Some good points, which require more thought.  Some initial responses:   I don't think """"Ukraine in WWI"""" is suitable, because most of the activity discussed in the article wasn't directly concerned with the war, and the period covered doesn't correspond to the duration of WWI (1914‚Äì1918).   """"Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire"""" would be better, but it only defines the period in question by what it followed. In contrast, """"in the Russian Revolution"""" is associated with the events covered herein.  I agree that """"History of Ukraine (1917-1922)"""" is the most neutral, but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about. I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation.  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly, rather than always having to type a piped link: [[History of Ukraine (1917-1922) |Ukraine in the Russian Revolution]].   The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here, and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921.  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution, but that will take a bit of reading first.   Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title?  Personally, I think it's neutral because it doesn't imply that Ukraine was Russian, but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire.   But as I wrote above, you make some good points.

False	January 2016 (UTC) Except the video I haven't seen anyone naming him as Mohammed Afroz except the video of IndiaToday earlier tagged there and as far as I remember the Delhi police never revealed his name. So I am highly doubtful. Despite whatever his name is, WP:BLPNAME prevents from naming someone whose name has been intentionally omitted officially including in court records and isn't allowed to be named publicly. In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true. Therefore, I am in agreement the previous edit versions containing all the various versions of his real name like Sunil and Mohammed Afroz should be deleted.   04:06, 8
False	This article about same-sex marriage.  In the lede, the issue of same-sex marriage is said to be a human rights issue, an equality under the law issue, a political issue.  The article says marriages are legal and social institutions.  The article then goes on to explain why some favor changing the law to recognize same sex marriage, and it explains why some oppose changing the law to include same sex marriage.   I don't see why a lawyer, a law professor, a politician, a judge, a law review article etc would not be considered an expert on the subject (if not they then who).  Also, the entire issue of being an expert was in regards to Self Published Sources only (Wikipedia states that a SPS may be used if the author is a recognized expert).  None of the citations are SPS  and if they were they are still experts. As I have told you law review articles are easily accessible due to the wonder of the internet, and I highly suggest you follow you own advice and read the citations above (and yes to answer your question I have verified the articles).

False	""" RE Thryduulf My closing statement was not aimed at any user in particular, which you can tell by the fact that I did not refer to any users in particular. You did not specify user names, but you did specify users by their arguments: """"unhelpful meta discussion about the use of T: prefixes in general"""", but when an editor writes , incorrectly, you do not use that argument. This way my arguments were rejected explicitly in one stroke, while wrong arguments are still weighing in. The same can be said for the overstated """"consensus"""": not thrown out (more on this later). You also have used the comment that it is , which is a malversion of my arguments (you did not find). From all this I feel & read that only my arguments were targeted off-topic.  ... not whether T: redirects in general should be deleted. This is bs. I reasoned like: """"a T: redirect is bad in mainspace, so these twelve should all be deleted"""". Plain sound reasoning. I did use argumental examples in some places, but I did not, nowhere, argue that other, non-listed Rs are to be deleted. It was someone else who expanded it into too wide  not me. Keep'er """"Technical 13"""", I admid this is a third Keep'er, invokes an """"WP:NS#Aliases"""". But this time it must be deemed not too general (I can not follow, but I must conclude that). If """"Keep"""" individual pages were reasoned to be kept, why not conclude the the others are to go? Requirement for individual mentioning only works one way? Also, in one point you complain that there was """"no discussion about the individual redirects"""". Well, that could also be because an argument applies to the whole list (a logic you disallowed explicitly). Then, when I do point to individually addressed Rs (here above, linked), you do not see a contradiction in that. Even worse, when I do demonstrate there are Rs named specifically, you respond here with but not everybody agreed with you. This does not undo my point that individual templates were addressed. Confusingly, here you are jumping the reasoning. As was repeatedly pointed out the most recent times that it was discussed the consensus was that at least some were useful and that there was no consensus for a prohibition on their creation or use. Here it is you introducing arguments from *outside* the RfD list at hand. Earlier RfD's outcomes as an argument? How am I allowed to argue with that? WhenI use an argument involving general sanity (not even stepping outside this RfD), it ends up in the bin. And, above I linked tot two more recent R deletion conclusions (a G6 """"non-controversial"""" speedy! March 2013, and a full RfD-list deletion in December 2010), that contradict your reasoning. Also you write T: as a prefix or the use of such prefixes in general in the closing and XfD not RfD here. That is an expansion of the topic beyond RfD. Why is that allowed? It doesn't matter how long ago a consensus was reached - it applies until there is a newer consensus formed, it doesn't somehow expire.and Consensus can change, and older consensuses are often more likely to, but ....  No  was reached. Repeat: there is no consensus. You are repeating an editors' 2007 injection -not a conclusion- into an essay. With that, indeed it is irrelevant how long ago the irrelevance was written: today it is still irrelevant. II note that you took over this bogus claim from an editor. As for old or new 'consensus': can an admin research & report how many T:-redirect were deleted without RfD, over the years? Of course, they leave almost no trace for non-admins. But I'd like to see the numbers & arguments for all T:-redirect deletions since template space was introduced. Some 'consensus' must be visible in there too. There is no consensus. So there is no argument from that  non-existent consensus. And don't blame me for introducing """"history"""" as a reason.   Yes, you argued about specific redirects, but not everybody agreed with you. Out of logic. Why do you say this? You concluded that there was no individual targeting (and check that the nom is addressing them by listing them, and that the nom is detailing arguments very specific). The I point to them, and you jump to arguments. Did you or did you not see them when closing?   In particular your proving that transclusion didn't work was argued to be not relevant to way the redirect was used (remember these are redirects to templates not templates), and and your opinion alone does not demonstrate consensus. A catch 22 you created. First you complain that no individual Rs were mentioned, then I point to one that was already there, and then you say: but that is not consensus.

And if you look past the gun nuts comment, you'll see that I was arguing their position for them. Every one of these shootings brings the gun-control advocates out of the woodwork, and nothing comes of it, hence there is no point in bringing it up in the article. The paragraph in the article that states the school's gun policy, with no context, is also irrelevant and should be removed. The fact of where the guy got the guns might be relevant. However, I'm not about to be editing articles that are in an extreme state of flux. In that situation, more discussion is needed and less tinkering with the article. That would be the wikipedia way. Unfortunately, human nature is what it is.  What's up, Doc?

I respect your and everyone's views but I respect Wikipedia policies too. I've never said that I'm going to include her name regardless of what other users think. I have instead said that I would like to prefer discussing this matter in a civil manner and that's what I have been doing. The main Wikipedia policy is adding verified information. Any verified information that is significant cannot be removed. But still I preferred discussion because I think it is probably the best thing to do.

I don't see what is wrong with making up such a list.

This would result in a list of say 24 individuals and can list where the came from to expand the job-stub of Wiki and provide interesting and useful reference information about who is who in government in Ontario Regions.

False	Sorry im not that knowledgable about that. What has been on the news this last month has been that sectors of the commuter network (the suburban train network) are being closed to convert them to the high speed network which will connect to guadalajara, im actually a bit confused and frustrated about this myself. And about the Priesmangoode design, what happened is Siemens original tender in the competition was the Velero, however it was given little interest due to lobbying by the Japanese with the E5 which at that point seemed like it would for sure become the winner. And Priestmangoode is only a designer so the need an actual manufacturing firm if they want their concept to come to life. They tried to interest other firms in Britain with the design but that didnt go anywhere. The Mexican transportaion secretary had already stated in the very beginging that a double decker system was preferable and since Siemens Velaro was pretty much already out of the compettition Siemens took back it's tender. Siemens then jointly (with priesmangoode) presented the concept to the Mexican transportation secretary that it could jointly manufacture the double decked Mercury design. But what really is the main aspect of why Siemens bid will probably win is because they are wiling to have the rolling stock fully manufactured in Mexico. This was in the July 2008 issue of Ferrocarril. In the end no real progress was really made in the final selection because then the Japanese and the French gave the same offer of manufacuring the trains in Mexico after Siemens came up with the concept so we still have to wait till 2011 to find out who wins / 69.235.193.67

What you have here is a page zealously defended by a bunch of nuts who are so zealous about their complete disassociation from Underwood despite comments by Church co-creator Ivan Stang regarding him AND conversations with him, that the protestations are evidence themselves of his effect on the Church.

At 3:37 in the same clip a magazine cut out showing the UHRO organization logo is shown as printed by them - an asymmetrical """"U"""", a flaming bomb inside it and a chequoy on the bomb. It looks just like the one Nanin7 had made and DIREKTOR removed (bar the dark-blue color which Nanin7 used to fill in the letter U). The original is black-and-white but the letter itself clearly wasn't meant to be black. At 5:03 in the same clip the front page of the organization's statute is shown, again, with the same logo as described above, dated 1932. At 5:22 the narrator talks about the organization logo directly and says that """"The """"Usta≈°a"""" was defined as a revolutionary fighter, also indicated by their logo, which first appeared in the masthead of the magazine """"Usta≈°a"""" in 1930. Inside a blue letter """"U"""" a silver hand grenade is depicted, with red flames coming out of it. In the centre of the bomb a small Croatian coat of arms is shown, with the top left field in silver."""" As he is saying that yet another picture of the logo is being shown (this one seems to be an enamel badge). The text btw was written by one Mario Jareb, a historian who wrote several books on the history of the Usta≈°e as well as one on the history of Croatian national symbols. At 5:55 in the same clip front page of yet another party newspaper titled """"Nezavisna dr≈æava Hrvatska"""" (published in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco), with the same logo shown, this time in the form of an initial in the main headline, dated 1 May 1934.  So I don't know how much more official can it get. As for the """"several variant"""" thing - I can only assume they dropped the bomb once NDH was established (since per their logic, the revolutionary struggle has achieved its goal) and replaced it with just a chequoy which was then used as a state symbol later on. I've never seen a cross in combination in contemporary use, only in modern far-right graffiti, but I may be wrong. Either way, this article is about the Usta≈°e party/movement and this version is the closest we will ever come to what was their official symbol. Only the shade of the color blue can be considered debatable (I tend to think it was probably lighter blue than what Nanin7 used).  (''talk) """

My impression at this stage is that most editors seem to think Mr Roberts doesn't meet our general notability guideline because he hasn't received enough coverage in reliable sources. That he has won an award for his blog wouldn't normally make him notable unless it was a very significant award. Winning a notable award doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. But it's also possible that someone who isn't notable now, might very well be notable in the future. We call that WP:TOOSOON. In cases like that, the best bet would be to ask for the article to be userfied which means it is moved to your own user space until the subject is notable enough for the article to be published in the main article space. I have a couple of articles like that sitting in my own userspace.   At the end of the day, it's not really about """"protecting"""" an article from deletion, it's about the Wikipedia community protecting the encyclopaedia from the inclusion of everyone and everything, ever.

That way, if one of your articles is taken to AFD, at least you'll have a much broader understanding of policy and deletion procedures.

Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.  Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

This is an important viewpoint from a renown Islamic scholar, thus this opinion must be included in the article. Although this statement was there in the article it was removed by certain editors kept on insisting that the sources were not reliable. I would therefore like to list a series of sources that confirm this statement was made. Please view , , ,  or  to see him saying this live on television. You can also get videos of his lectures in India/Pakistan. Various articles have been written on it and there are several web pages discussing it ( just to list a few ,  ). Thus there is no doubt on the importance of this statement given how thoroughly it has been discussed by people all over India and elsewhere. Furthermore since the statement was made on television, so I do nor see a problem with reliability of sources. Editors who disagree should explain why they disagree before removing related content from the article.

Dr pda, though, just pointed out that a lot of FAs don't have the  template on the talk page anymore, to avoid talkpage clutter, and instead have the DYK mentioned in , meaning that if we wanted to go forward with this we would probably have to add some code in  to put the talkpage into one of those categories if  has both DYK and GA/FC.

False	The way I interpreted the wording was that they were specific, clarificatory applications of the primary criteria to the different situations of different kinds of organisation, neither optional alternatives (since notability established according to the alternate criteria would automatically satisfy the primary criteria) nor optional substitutions. As for the national/international issue, they clearly state that NGOs whose activities are purely local are only notable if they have received national/international coverage. The Circle of Reason has received national (Harvard Pluralism Project) attention for local (Minnesota Secular Bible Study) activities, and also has international activity - groups in other countries. The guidelines state that once notability has been established by independent sources (Harvard Pluralism Project, Star Tribune), primary sources (TCOR website, Dutch Cirkel website etc) can be used to provide information. Distracting readers from sourced evidence for notability is not really a concern; establishment of notability is the 'qualification' for inclusion in Wikipedia, once the topic is so qualified the article should contain all relevant information on the topic that can be cited to reliable sources. The international scope of the organisations obviously relevant information.

All they get from the link is vague intimations that somebody, somewhere thinks fighting from the knees is realistic. The other cited article is even less specific. Ideally, to cite a myth/misconception you should link to an actual case of someone stating that myth - e.g. an article stating that swords weighed 30 lbs - and then to a rebuttal article, or to an article that gives the source of the misconception as well as a rebuttal. Otherwise the reader has no way of knowing that the articles are actually addressing a real argument, rather than knocking down straw men.

False	"""   First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara‚Äôs mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.   Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:  """"Balance  Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc.    Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:   he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)  (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)  (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)  (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)  (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)  (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)  It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.      Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it).

As a linguist I prefer to talk about 'language groups' as this is, in many cases, the highest level of group affiliation (altho people from different language groups can have ceremonial, and other, ties).  Someone (Ezeu) moved yamaji to the list of tribes, but I'm going to remove it. Yamaji is the word for 'man, human being' in Wajarri and is also one of the words used for that meaning in Badimaya. As such it, like ngayarda in the Pilbara and Koori in south-east Australia is used to refer to Aboriginal people from a particular region (the Murchison-Gascoyne region of WA), but may also be used to refer to Aboriginal people from any part of Australia. It's not a 'tribe' in any sense that I can determine.

Here he would be stripped of his admin bit for that, and it looks like he's done it more than once. I recognise that the Wikispecies community will be unwilling to castigate its most prolific editor, but evidence like that speaks for itself. He was briefly de-sysopped there before, and has been blocked, for edit warring and personal attacks, and further warnings were given in the last month. It doesn't bode well.

I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion.

The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths."""

False	Wikipedia Ambassador Program is looking for Campus Ambassadors in Houston   Hi!  I'm leaving you this message because you are listed as a Wikipedian connected with the University of Houston.  The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at another Houston school, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.  Prior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).  If you live in Houston and you are interested in being a Wikipedia Campus Ambassador, or know someone else from the area who might be, please email me or leave a message on my talk page.

Copyright issues report   Hi, I've mentioned the copyright problems here. Any help you can give in removing material that you know you've copy-pasted, and then noting that it's been removed, would be appreciated.  (talk)  I doubt anyone would want you to quit (I know I don't!), but it is very important that you respect copyrights.  IMHO, nothing is a bigger threat to the continued success of Wikipedia than copyvios.  The potential for the foundation to get sued is far bigger than it is for libel by far.  I have been screamed at, told off and generally put in my place dozens of time since I have been here and fully expect that I will again, many times.  It would be really nice if everyone here was kind and respectful, but, just like society in general, that just isn't the case.  My suggestion to you is to ask questions, get help when you need it, make friends and continue to work on articles you like.  The best thing I did after I got here was to get adopted.  There is no textbook for this, and adoption provides you with a teacher that will walk you through the ropes, and be around after you graduate to mentor you.  Another great thing here is the Teahouse.  It is a place especially for newer users to ask questions and get answers without attitude.  My dad always used to say that the only stupid question was the one you didn't ask, and the Teahouse definitively follows that credo.  I will leave you an invite after this message.  I will also be happy to help you in any way I can.  Just drop a note on my talk page.  Welcome to Wikipedia, and happy editing!     Hi, Sk8terguy27.

Russian and Indian economies   If you check the the numbers, you will see that on most economical measures Russia has a larger GDP than India, such as nominal GDP. As nominal GDP represents total market value, it is most frequently used when talking about superpowers. India has a larger PPP GDP, but Russia has a much higher per capita GDP than India in both categories. Overall, Russia has a higher HDI index. Your statement that India has a higher GDP than Russia is accurate in only a narrow sense and based on a single GDP calculation. 71.112.145.211    India is way ahead of Russia in terms of GDP (PPP) (see List of countries by GDP (PPP)) and just behind Russia in terms of GDP (nominal) (see List of countries by GDP (nominal)). We are talking over here national economies and not just economy from per capita perspective. Also, India has a higher GDP growth rate than Russia (see List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate) and according to BRIC report, India's GDP (nominal) will be four times that of Russia's by 2050 and that is a very important factor considering this is an article on potential superpowers.      India is not way ahead of Russia, Russia is way ahead of India. Everything in India is Russian suchs as military arsenals, rockets, missiles, fight jets, commercial jets, ships, subs and etc. Russia is a superpower and India is not quite a superpower. There are many reasons why Russia is a superpower and that is a long discussion. Russia is the number military forces in the world and the worlds largest military arsenal builder. India is a big population and smart people but Russia is has unique things about it that India hasn't.  ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by 78.129.197.69     The bigger issue here, however, is those little bar charts.

Other examples: La cit√© des enfants perdus, What Dreams May Come, Adaptation and Being John Malkovich.

False	"""   IMAGE DELETIONS   Carnildo says you deleted two images from the article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Joseph_Cormier that were posted by another WikipediA Administrator http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Earl_Andrew. Is there a hierarchal structure system among Administrators so one can overrule another without discussion?  One image showed the subject of the article wearing the gag """"Fear of the Truth"""" over his mouth as he was beat up and removed from the Visitors Gallery of the Canadian House of Commons on the first day of televised debate in history. That would make it an image associated with history, in Canada at least.  Understanding WikipediA respects copyrite restrictions, the tag applied to the deleted images reads as follows:  Because the image is historically significant, the entire image is needed to identify the subject, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image. Low resolution?  The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable for uses that would compete with any commercial purpose of the photograph. Purpose of use  Identification and critical commentary in the article, a subject of public interest. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed next to the associated material discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Replaceable?  Because the image depicts a non-reproducible historic event, there is almost certainly no free equivalent. Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended, would tarnish or misrepresent its image, or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary. Other information Use of the historic image in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above. The image meets general Wikipedia content requirements and is encyclopaedic.  It will take some time before the Article is so widely known by the public, there is a 0% probability any newspaper will want to claim copyvio considering the subject.  Will you please undo what you did until there is a free and fair discussion by users? If there is any tag that could be associated to the disputed images to stimulate discussion, do that. The Editors of the Ottawa Citizen have been aware of its images on the Article since they were posted by Earl Andrew.  DoDaCanaDa (talk)       You should probably address this to User:East718, as he's the one who deleted the images. My bot merely removed them from the article.

False	Agnes of Aquitaine   Hey David.  If you have time for an article can you create one about Agnes of Aquitaine, the second wife of Ramiro I of Aragon and the daughter of William VI or VII of Aquitaine?  But you would have to be a little creative about naming her because there is already a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre and a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon, and this Agnes' birth and death date are unknown.   Just doing that.  I'm going to clean up the entire list.   Just create a stub. Check Isabella of Urgel's article, it's as short as Agnes' article will be and she had a son who was king.   Thanks David.  You did a fantabulous job. You probably should change the first paragraph to show how her indentity is disputed and how the indentity of her father is disputed between William VI and William VII.   I don't know. I wish he'll take it less seriously, I mean I can't put any dates that are historically guessed.  He and Srnec are the same.  He seem to only altered Agnes' page but Ermesinda's page seems pretty intact with a few arrangement changes. BTW have you checked any of my new lists, you can check some out at Category:Lists of countesses, Category:Lists of duchesses, Category:Lists of princesses, and Category:Lists of queens.   I moved it. As for Majorca, it'll be finished after I added the independent queen consorts.  Do you think another page should be created for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy since Agnes, wife of Ramiro I of Aragon isn't really even on both Agnes?  Agricolae removed all the children of the Savoyard Agnes of Aquitaine.   Yeah I saw that connection of Bertha and Agnes, but we can't be sure if there were one or two Agnes.

Diannaa's block is in retailiation to a comment placed ON MY TALK PAGE (my userspace),   """"how can I disrupt my own talk page?""""  commenting on her behavior,  and warning that I might seek admin action against perceived abuse by her.  Calling another editor's behavior """"schoolmarmish"""" and expressing that one believes that pursuing petty conflicts is highly negative and toxic,  is certainly fair and within the bounds of the """"abuse policy.""""  Responding to such a comment (placed on own talk page) with a block,  is simply a personal,  personal-conflict-motivated attack.  And with all respect even assuming previous """"warning"""" was valid in its concern,  block per the user abuse policy requires multiple repetition.  This was and is a single incident,  and only attempts at discussion (however phrased) have ensued.  The block appears to be because Diannaa is in an active disagreement with me,  and I'm challenging her behavior,  and what I see as abusive,  inappropriate use of threats.  The above is highly negative behavior,  abuse of the blocks system,  a """"personal attack"""" on its face, reflects negatively on WikiPedia and its environment,  contradicts the """"blocks are a last resort to prevent (true) disruption,  use discussion first"""" policy,  and seems to be an attempt to suppress discussion of dissenting ideas on various policies or just plain,  Diannaa's reaction to being disagreed with.  In the end,  threats,  including threats of blocks,  are not discussion.  If one says """"well,  the rules aren't so clear,  let's talk about this"""" and gets back,  """"you're violating the rules,  I'll block you!!!"""",  then the system isn't working.  If one replies to the previous,  """"let's take it to talk,  let's discuss"""" and gets in return """"there's nothing to discuss"""" ... well,  I've read WP's policy documents,  and you may disagree with me,  but I think they could use some revision and clarification.  That's where this dispute began,  and how we got here.  One should not be blocked,  for expressing a contrary opinion in discussion,  on one's own talk page,  and informing an editor or administrator that one finds their actions abusive.  One should not be blocked,  for expressing a contrary opinion in discussion,  on one's own talk page,  by the person one is debating.  In the end,  what's the rationale here?  What ongoing disruption or pattern of abuse is this designed to prevent?  That I'll post disagreement on my talk page?!?  One is supposed to *think* before issuing a ban,  not fly off the handle!  This is personal retaliation there's no ongoing abuse or disruption,  other than some strongly-worded opposition to the current phrasing of the abuse policy,  itself quite far away from """"using disruption to make a point.""""  {{unblock"""

Dorvaq, thank you for the pointer, where I see """"Newspapers, for instance, almost universally refer to any indicted but unconvicted criminal as an alleged criminal.""""  Agreed; I use 'alleged' whenever writing about someone where crimes have been charged but not yet proven in a court of law.  Perhaps what I'm trying to ask is more of a common-sense question to which the answer is so obvious that no one has thought to incorporate it in a policy or guideline here.  Trying again, """"Once an accused criminal is convicted in a court of law, is it not both inappropriate and biased to insist on using the word 'alleged' when writing about the charges of which he's been convicted?""""  Maybe someone has a pointer to an old discussion or arbitration about this?  It seems that it must have come up in the past.    I'm pretty sure there is no discussion involving the generic use of """"allege"""" (or any derivative thereof) specific to before-and-after trials.  However, there has been many discussions of this sort on individual article pages involving criminals. But, most of these discussions have been initiated by either anonymous users or users who contribute very little to Wikipedia besides the article in question.  Perhaps your best bet would to start there unless someone else can provide you with something more informative.  Anyhow, I don't believe this needs to be incorporated into policy/guideline beyond how the word has already been treated.  In terms of law, to allege is to present without proof or without first proving.  Therefore, to state the convicted crime of an offender as an allegation is inherently contradictory. Wikipedia is dedicated to quality and integrity ‚Äî anything contradictory fails on those two points, but that's my opinion. ‚Äî  (talk)   Ah, that last paragraph hits the nail on the head, thanks.  Nothing like logic to prove a point.  I came upon the Megan Kanka article by chance and I remember the case quite well.  It really irked me, after removing all the 'allegeds' and cleaning up the article, to find an old entry on the Talk page stating """"He argues that he was wrongfully convicted; if he admitted to the allegations, they wouldn't be alleged, but he hasn't, so therefore they're 'alleged,' and he's the 'alleged killer.'""""

Because this bridge must have been amazing as it doubled the longest span of stone bridges then (from 37 to 72). Still, the briidge is almost unknown, as nobody covers the subject.   There is also a claim that the Etruscans build very early on stone arch bridges (earlier than both Greeks and Romans). Two of them are included in Structurae, but I am not sure whether these are still the original structures. Including the Etruscans in a comprehensive history of stone arch bridges would definitely be an almost revolutionary thing.

Not much of anything, other than let the boys slip.

But the hazards that you're concentrating on with coal, namely so-called anthopogenic climate change and global warming (and related junk science) are not the principle hazards.  Many of the reasons why certain aspects of the combustion are even being discussed (like the idea of CO2 capture) are not because of good science and/or true hazards, but rather scientific ignorance and very bad, very totalitarian policy.  23:03

No source has been provided to support the claim that the reason for the arrest was anything other than breaking the protesting law. FACT is that a Wikipedia editor claiming """"Police reports a BS"""" needs some good evidence.

False	"""   Northern Cyprus edits   I will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many Northern Cyprus-related articles.  I oppose, however, to your sneaky removal of links to Cyprus / Island of Cyprus / Republic of Cyprus, usually replacing them with links to Northern Cyprus, sometimes even making double or triple links to NC to avoid linking to the island of / Republic of Cyprus. I also notice that all your newly created articles about places in NC do not have any mentions at all about  RoC, not even the de jure/de facto distinction. That is definitely POV editing.  I oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, replacing any mention with """"the events of 1974"""" or your new favorite """"the hostilities of 1974"""". These euphemisms do not give any information to the user of Wikipedia, they only create questions: """"Which events?"""", """"Which hostilities?"""". You have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the 1974 √≠nvasion. These edits are definitely disruptive POV edits.  In your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content, you only mention additions of mayors, population figures etc., which are obviously good additions. The disruptive edits I have mentioned above are never mentioned (which is why I used the word """"sneaky""""). To make it even worse, you are using false edit summaries. When you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary """"syntax"""", it is not only disruptive, it is plain dishonest.  In a week's time I will again be able to edit regularly in Wikipedia, and I will then begin to revert your POV edits. In the meantime you could help, by reverting your worst POV edits. If not, the least you can do is to refrain from any more POV edits with dishonest edit summaries.

That US couple wanted to raise Shamema as a Christian, which Sloan did not want.  No gov't agencies of any sort were involved in that action. Sloan's wife as the time had been coerced by the paid agents. The coersion by their agent included implied threats against the health and safety of that woman's own children, but those threats occurred outside of US territory.  During Sloan's time as a fugitive, the gov't of the USA had custody of him multiple times and chose not to extradict him back to Virginia simply because of the expense involved.  Sloan was a fugitive in name only and only because one Viriginia judge was annoyed at him and he the authority to make him a fugitive rather than just let Shemama's natural parent raise her as he saw fit.  I am asking for balance in the presentation of this story. It is not as simple as the text currently suggests and the implications, as the the text currently stands, that Sloan was simply just another irresponsible, unfit parent.  Please review the facts and ensure that the text reflects the real ambiguities of the situation. We are not here to re-determine the best interests of Shamema: we are here to report the Truth w/o any implied defamation of Sloan's character.  He is a convicted felon and we make that clear enough, but was fail to present the proper context of the termination of his parental rights.

False	""" Dear Mr. Bunkov! Thank you kindly for your note. It is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of Wikipedia editors. Welcome again; I look forward to future cooperation, and I am sure other participants of WikiProject Russia will be equally delighted. That said, I feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in. Pardon me if you are already familiar with what I am about to say, but I feel it's safer to include it for the sake of completeness. Since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization, you should be extra mindful of Wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position, of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant. Another important point is that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, so it's not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional. Even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor, and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything. One cannot prohibit others from editing one's additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others. This, in fact, is one of the five pillars of Wikipedia. This isn't to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add, but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines. You'll notice, for example, that I've made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the Kaluga Oblast article‚Äîthis is not because the style you used is somehow inferior, but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on Russian oblasts. At any rate, style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance, and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of Wikipedia's Manual of Style. You should not, however, be surprised when others fix it. Style issues aside, Wikipedia is all about content, of course. It's understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share, but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources. What this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source, and the source must be a reliable one, published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and/or with editorial oversight. Ultimately, this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources, and in your situation it means that sources produced by the Government of Kaluga Oblast in general and by the Agency for Regional Development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary (not secondary) source. Primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts, but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed. In other words, it's OK to to use a primary source to back up a statement that Kaluga Oblast's GRP in 2010 was 214.5 billion rubles, but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like """"this demonstrates the oblast's high economic potential"""". With formalities and general introductions taken care of, let's address your question about """"Kaluga Oblast"""" somehow being a wrong translation. That actually is not the case. The term """"oblast"""" is a loanword in the English language, included in all major dictionaries, and it is much more precise than a more vague """"region"""", """"territory"""", or """"province"""". This isn't to say that any of those terms are """"wrong""""‚Äîthey are not‚Äîbut they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as Wikipedia's due to their ambiguity. This issue had been discussed on several past occasions, and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one. Precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article's title. Note also that all major English-language reference works use the term """"oblast"""" (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica). Additionally, since the article about Kaluga Oblast is a part of the series on the Russian oblasts, its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles. WP:NCCS is the applicable guideline covering all this, if you are interested in reviewing it. I hope this has been helpful. I apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once, but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor, I feel certain points should have been touched upon. If you have any further questions or need anything clarified, you are welcome t"

False	"""        Ethiopian Airlines   Hello. May I ask why you removed the fact that the Somaliland region is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia from the Ethiopian airlines article? You do realize that the airline itself, like the international community as a whole, does not recognize any such country called """"Somaliland"""" and only includes Somalia in its literature (e.g. here), right? In fact, it doesn't even mention Somaliland on its website [2]. So what gives? Is there a second Ethiopian Airlines website I should know about? Also, in your second revert [3], you completely removed the Frequent Flyer Program section that I had just added. What's the point of that too? Why not just revert the Somaliland section if that is all you object to? Why a wholesale revert? Regards, Middayexpress (talk)   Hi. Thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia. There is an article in Wikipedia for Somaliland where the readers can get all the information they need, including the ones you mention. Wikipedia is simply an encyclopedia, where neutral points of view should be stated. That said, it doesn't matter whether the airline or even Ethiopia recognises Somaliland or not, the only thing that matters is that it flew once to a destination within its territory. Moreover, it doesn't matter to which state (recognised or not even by the UN) Hargeisa is the capital of as to an article concerning any airline, not only Ethiopian. As already stated in the Airline Project guidelines, airline articles as well as pages related to their destinations should only reflect information with neutral points of view. Regarding ShebaMiles, the frequent flyer programme and its description is properly depicted within the codeshare agreements sub-section of the Destinations section, where it is also stated that the company has a codesahre agreement with Lufthansa, as with many other airlines. Scattering information related to the same stuff all through the article renders it disordered. Best wishes.Jetstreamer (talk)   Thanks for your response. Articles should indeed reflect a neutral point of view. However, removing clarification of the fact that the city of Hargeisa is internationally recognized as a part of Somalia is not neutral. It's actually the opposite of neutral since all of the other images on the Ethiopian Airlines article that show actual Ethiopian Airlines aircraft in various airports around the world all list country-level destinations (viz. United Arab Emirates, England, Ethiopia). They do not list regional-level destinations; only the Hargeisa picture does and that's the point. Unless one wants to deliberately give the impression that Somaliland is recognized as country of its own on par with the aforementioned actual nations, a clarifying note will have to be added indicating that the Somaliland region is actually internationally regarded as a region of Somalia. This is even more necessary considering the fact that Ethiopian Airlines itself doesn't even appear to acknowledge any such sub-national let alone national entity; it only recognizes Somalia in its literature, as shown above (please leave a response if any here so that the discussion is all in one place). Regards, Middayexpress (talk)   Do you think the last change I made to Ethiopian Airlines destinations solves the issue? Please let me know what you think. I added the flag of Somalia so as to appear with that of Somaliland, and also modified the caption of the last image. Please let me know what you think. Cheers.Jetstreamer (talk)   That won't do because Somaliland is still listed in the country column alongside actual countries, including the Somalia which it is internationally regarded as an autonomous region of. It is also the only such disputed territory listed on the table and in such a way. That makes the presentation still far from neutral. And that's not even mentioning the main Ethiopian Airlines article, which still requires a clarificatory note, as explained above. Middayexpress (talk)   Kindly removed Somaliland from the caption of the image in the Ethiopian Airlines article. I think we're done with that. Which is your proposal concerning Ethiopian Airlines destinations? Simply removing a terminated destination is clearly not the solution.Jetstreamer (talk)   That's one problem solved. For the Ethiopian Airlines destinations article, I recommend explaining via a footnote that Hargeisa is the """"capital of Somaliland, a self-declar"

False	""":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the """"good image"""" of Germany.     No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.      I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!     Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.      First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!    In theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't """"settled"""". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.     Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) """"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike.

The authors' criterion for inclusion was that the individuals in the study have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. They were psychiatric patients. That's why they excluded for consideration 46 of the 50 studies on anxiety that they found. They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: """"Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase."""" Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM. Cochrane looked at a single study on TM.  Eppley looked at every study on TM that related to anxiety. Most of these were nonclinical studies, that is, they included subjects that hadn't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. These studies, both meditation and relaxation, most commonly used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standardized assessment of anxiety levels that's been validated in hundreds of studies, to assess the level of anxiety in the subjects. His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM.

Jon Gibson is """"overly"""" sourced on his article, I made sure of that as a user with a different user name/ip/id in the past. Secondly, iTunes/TCM/GMA/CBN/CCM and the radio sites as well as the artist's actual websites are valid sources. I removed all sources Walter said only had """"books"""" and """"albums"""" listed, although if [you] scroll down or look for a different tab to see the """"bio"""" or """"description"""" sections, it would confirm what my entry claimed. The above 17'ish sources listed in another section were ones I removed and I did not need to be advised what was wrong with them, they are only being """"saved"""" for future reference. Third off, this article didn't give any diversity which was an element I wanted the genre to reflect. Within the About.com that was recently removed and within the actual article of the artists (ie. Randy Stonehill), this statement can be verified. It gives a better idea of the veteran and popular CCM artists that the article didn't mention, those who are significant and some award winning """"record breakers"""" (if nothing else just diversity in race/nationality such as Carman and Kirk Franklin which I provided reliable sources for).  """"Word press"""", """"CCM Top 500 albums"""" and Kirk Franklin honored by CCM on his website are all valid points made on the credible sources I provided.   Contemporary Christian music also became popular with secular musicians as well, including Stevie Wonder,  Johnny Cash, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and M.C. Hammer (who vowed to God he would include at least one song of praise on each album). Bands like P.O.D. and Creed contained Christian themes within their lyrics yet still appealed to a secular audience.

False	I will deal with your input above but desist from calling me by that name. I understand you've been doing this on other sites in the Wikipedia system. You are a frustrated man and I think we should meet to discuss this problem you have with me as Pakhtun Tanoli. Is it because other Pakhtuns have been challenging you after my contributions to the debate regarding Pakhtun status of Tanolis. You've have been peddling this name about on different sites in Wikipedia and I've left it for proud Pakhtuns and others to challenge you. Get it into your ignorant head that Tanolis are Pakhtuns and Janjuas are kasbis (I know at least 3 families of Janjua origin who do not claim to rajputs but say they are of Maliyar caste. None of the historical sources link them with rajputs. Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara, in Manakrai,and they are not rajputs either - read about Raja of Mahmoodabad. Moreover, the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity (the term raja is reserved for the rulers). As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along. Darbar-e-Akbari, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara, and more importantly, from real Rajputs as well.   I accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis. We know who the gujjar families are in Tanawal and they do not use Tanoli for themselves though they do say they reside in Tnawal. Other Gujjars in Hazara are either settled or are move about between Swat, Upper hazara and Azad Kashmir.  Additionally, you seem to be on a mission to prove something that is not proveable. I know you are in the UK and I can meet you face to face to discuss this if you prefer. We can sort a number of things relevant to this debate as well as you can know who I really am.

If it was directed at me I hope you realize I'm only trying to improve this article by expanding on the introduction while still keeping it concise.    The reason I listed those other topics is because the current intro only talks about the War on Terror.  While that's most likely the biggest part of Bush's presidency, it's not the only thing that happened.  I wanted to inform readers of other things that have gone on during Bush's time as president.  If I were to elaborate on all of that, it would make the intro ridiculously long.  So I thought to list them and figured if anyone is interested they can check the rest of the article where those topics are all addressed in more detail.    Hopefully we can discuss this, because I feel that the intro should accurately reflect that the War wasn't the only thing happening during Bush's presidency.   """

Conversely, the reader's usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide/continental list: if you're interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial Wiki pages, while if you aim to a world overview, it's somewhat tiring to ‚Äúsearch, open & match‚Äù a handful of different article.

False	"""   Timeshifter's dishonesty   Timeshifter, your story above is text-book projection, first rate water-muddying, I grant you, but deceit nonetheless. But this follows the pattern of your edits. Your POV is clear throughout. It's pretty simple: you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth, and, therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off. IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate, ILCS is not """"legitimate"""" etc. Basically every edit you've made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs. Now you're pissed that I've ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POV-pushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it, and now you're playing the victim.   Let's put that act aside and look at what I've actually deleted. I've reverted basically three things here:   1. Lancet page - claims about a supposed """"ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate"""". Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages. I deleted that fabrication. The only """"sourced material"""" I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough, but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing. Once the fabricated """"ILCS baseline rate"""" is removed, the surrounding """"sourced material"""" from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section. It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication. The """"sourced material"""" that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there, so I removed it along with the fabrication.   2. IBC page - I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter. I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something, and provided a citation for this. Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC, and he puts a footnote onto this, but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely. Thus, this claim of Timeshifter's is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else, and the citation leads to something that is different than how it's described.   So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications. Apparently it's """"against the rules"""" and """"POV-favoring"""" to delete POV-pushing falsehoods and fabrications.  3. IBC page - Guatemala study. I've questioned the relevance of this to IBC, and the accuracy of the description, and discussed this on the talk page. This one is at least more debatable than the others, as it is just tangential cherry-picking for a POV, rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV.  Deleting these three things has been my great crime, causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish, yeah right. As I've already said, I can't keep up with Timeshifter's proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages. He's very commited to the cause, as proselytizers tend to be."""

The Crown tried to appeal and were REFUSED! They had to pay costs. That is it! Why you wish to try and go beyond such is beyond me and it would appear all others. If it irks you that dad is a lawyer who practises worldwide then that is your problem. Don't inflict it upon others. my dad has a million and one faults but being a lawyer is NOT one of them. If you want to blacken him as it seems you do I and my brothers and sister can certainly tell you his faults. But for all his faults he is a great dad, always there notwithstanding he is away a lot and has done his best showing us love, affection and given us security despite his personal life. He is in Iraq a lot, he has access to HVD (High Value Detainees) represents Tariq Aziz, just managed to release Humad Humadi, even certain presidents dont get near Camp Cropper. If dad was not a lawyer do you think he would have access to the highest level of security in the world????? Or maybe he is a spy or something I guess that will be your next suggestion..... if you want scandal about dad find it elsewhere not where you are looking. MSDS

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women.   Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006   A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member‚Äôs rib and both men‚Äôs glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building.   ‚ÄúPolice were at the church watching everything,‚Äù Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. ‚ÄúThey even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.‚Äù   Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with ‚Äúred wax‚Äù immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building.   In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, ‚ÄúNo Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,‚Äù the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church‚Äôs right to exist.   Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were ‚Äúno followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdecrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.‚Äù   In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence.   In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building.   ‚ÄúThis is nonsense,‚Äù said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. ‚ÄúWe can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.‚Äù   As a Protestant community in Lebanon, ‚Äúwe have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,‚Äù Sahyouni told Compass. ‚ÄúWe do not need to get permission.‚Äù   Worship Rights   In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building.   The bishop‚Äôs biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock.   ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?‚Äù the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other‚Äôs members. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.‚Äù   The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajalt

False	However one must understand that there are many intelligent africans and many dumb europeans.  There is only a difference in the frequency of what you can find.  As to the flynn effect, it has been surmised by others that the I.Q. increases are due to better nutrition.  People today are much taller than they were a hundred years ago and have a larger brain size.  This change is solely due to better nutrition.  It has been shown in many studies the nutritional deficienciess can lower I.Q..  However, having a higher i.q. means that you can get better nutrition for your child and thus add even more i.q. points.  So africa's average I.Q. of around 70 is lower than it's potential as evidenced by american blacks who have an I.Q. of about 85.  However this is probably the upper limit as to what african blacks could achieve since there is significant white admixture in american black populations.  Studies of adopted children have shown that asian children tend to have I.Q.'s significantly greater than their adoptive parents (110)  while black children have I.Q.'s that are lower than their adoptive parents (90).  So evidence points to the I.Q. gap being at least partially genetic.

False	History of K.M.F. (Kill-Marry-Fuck):  The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella‚Äîresident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA‚Äîin the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as ‚ÄúKill-Marry-Fuck‚Äù between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.  Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, ‚ÄúKill-Marry-Fuck.‚Äù  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University‚Äôs Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.  Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue‚Äôs pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston‚Äôs neighboring cities.  At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally.   # #

False	The replacement for Mako is most likely Greg Baldwin. He has been a student of Mako's voice since 1977, and therefore is a great replacement. He has been working with avatar for some time.

If you pay attention, you can tell that his voice is different from Mako's. The first time Greg Baldwin was credited as Iroh was in the credits of the short 'School Time Shipping'.

I made some useful and positive edits to fix some talk page banner issues (only a few of thousands needed I might add); I asked a valid question to Dreadstar about how he could justify my edits as spam or vandalism, which they clearly were not and I made a couple of valid comments about an administrator that I have concerns about getting access to the checkuser tools. Nothing was harassing or constituted a personal attack. Maybe I could see bock evasion or something like trying to avoid scrutiny, but that's not what you said and judging by the comments on your talk page and your history you don't understand what the difference is. I don't really care that I am blocked mind you, I just think if you are going to do it, you should do it for truthful reasons not an obvious fabrication to justify an otherwise unjustifiable block. I would ask that you unblock this IP because I had planned on doing some more edits tonight including a couple of significant article contributions I had been crafting but its unlikely you will be doing that. If however you want to improve the project and build an encyclopedia then please unblock it so I can do so, otherwise if your NOTHERE to contribute to the encyclopedia as I am, then I guess those will have to wait. I will get them done eventually and will continue to refine them for when I am able to edit so its not going to stop me from improving articles, it just reduces the number I can improve and reduces the amount of time I have to do it. 96.255.237.170

False	√öbeda   Hello, sorry for the long message.  In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move √öbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).  However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).  However, for √öbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to √öbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote: Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues. See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).  As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:  Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?  Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond.

False	Delhi as Primary Hub  Air India recently made Delhi as its Primary Hub. This is very much true because Delhi has more Air India Flights than Mumbai. The reason for doing this was that Mumbai is over saturated and over-crowded compared to Delhi. Each and every new aircraft lands at Delhi during its delivery flight. Paris and Tokyo now originate from Delhi and not from Mumbai. No new destinations are being launched from Mumbai compared to Delhi which has seen Washington,D.C. and Toronto flights.

I am sure if its really necessary this theme could be supported by better sources, but the Daily Mail was just the most obvious example I came across at the time. I realy am not seeing the problem here. We are certainly not going to start removing content simply because it comes from 'anti-BBC' sources, and I am extremely concerned that there even seems to be a subtext here that the Mail were acting as some sort of proxy for the BNP.

False	""" Read very closely . Per WP:VERIFY and WP:BURDEN, the burden of proof that the image shows Godane has already been proven through the many, upon many reliable and reputable sources. You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do.  None of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( 'Suna times' and 'Waamo news').  No, there are not """"multiple images on Godane"""", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won't make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose't help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you're smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it's riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (""""Hammami is still advocating for Robow‚Äôs troopss."""") Are you kidding me? The author can't even spell, and you're taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn't identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn't help, as the author hasn't established where he got his information from concerning this supposed 'incorrect' image of Godane. Again, you're going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point. The basis that 'foreign media agencies' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not 'based'? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that's Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere. And finally, this. """"the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested """" -. So now you're willing to compromise? Ahh, I see!

As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.

So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.

He later became a Roman Catholic. At no stage in his life was he Jewish, nor did he ever identify himself as Jewish. Please see the discussion pages and don't revert my edits. He was defined as Jewish by the Nazi Party, because they made the innovation of treating Jews as a race, not a religious community.

False	Tom, I'm a novice at this, and am just now figuring out how to use my Talk page.  Yes, my view is that Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford and other royal wards.  In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.  The financial benefit of Oxford's wardship went to Leicester, as I've demonstrated from historical documents in my article in Brief Chronicles. Nina Green205.250.205.73

False	"""   Editing of Anthony Hungerford   Dear Phillip,                 My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset! I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.  My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again.  The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.  If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers ‚Äì because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?  Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated.

Unfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide """"truth"""" and """"lies"""".   The best you can do is present all sides (not just one, or two) and cite evidence.     For everything that is a lie, you can add sentences describing why it is untrue.  There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.  As we all know, many times history has been distorted and many people have been fooled, so don't be too sure that you know what really happened, when all most of us really have are hand-me-down stories.  Lastly, be sure not to get too wrapped up in articles.  Find other articles to edit and your experience will be much more fulfilling.   Come to visit Mao often, and put it on your watchlist, but don't let it consume you or sour you on wikipedia.   I can guarantee you that 10 years from now, there will STILL be edit wars on the Mao page.

I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?  Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -    Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it.

There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.     At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further.

Also when it came to the argument of Quebec nationalism being ethnic oriented as opposed to territorial I felt that again far too much POV dominated the presented thesis. The fact that study after study has shown that the vast majority of non-Francophones in Quebec, groups whose roots in the province go back just as far as the Francophones do not see themselves as being part of a Quebecois nation was ignored.

Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!  However, these things should be adressed:  Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.  The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.

Adoniscik I am the right source to provide this information because I am talking from experience.  I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner. As for the Israeli employees at EMU I can only provide again from first ahnd experience as one of his students that it was not anything to do with his nationality but honestly I don't think we were getting anything out of his classes. He just was not doing his job and at times making strange comments in his classes that were irritating students to the point that they would complain and sign a petition.   ‚ÄîPreceding unsigned comment added by  (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)    As a party to the conflict, that is a sign that you are not the right source to provide information from the article.

False	"""   Definition of witchcraft/Wicca   I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters. The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft. Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest. Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly. Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs. Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic. Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.  The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.  I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ‚òÖ """

False	"""  Rock or pop? I know it says rock and roll here, but the red album really does sound very teeny-popish. My music collection only has room for single genres (as in rock or pop, not rock/pop), so which one is it really?    It's rock    Actully, it is pop not rock. I aggree with  that it sounds very teeny-popish. Rock and roll is the same thing as rock. I think a lot of people shorten it as it sounds a bit cooler.  | I will respond.     Many problems   In addition to three items I tagged as  that appear to contradict what I can verify about the album, the table smacks of OR, and even then, some of the info in the table is incorrect.  As far as I can determine, both 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 were compiled by Allan Steckler, an employee of ABKCO (Allen Klein's company), which at that time was managing Apple Records in the United States. The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true """"greatest hits"""" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.     Choice of the colour red   I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).     I agree.  | I will respond.     Unauthorized Beatles compilations before """"1962-1966""""   Hi, anonymous user here. I found out about a 4-LP set called """"Alpha Omega"""" that was a Beatles compilation sold through infomercials back in 1972 that supposedly got EMI to compile the hits onto """"1962-1966"""" and """"1967-1970"""".

I read the reason for the page's deletion and the following may help you learn more information about this group of non treaty Montana Chippewa Indians. You claimed you searched for anything about Ahontoay on wikipedia. You can try searching by using the name Ahonteways but it won't work. Search by using the phrase User:Linniebc/SandBox. That will quickly lead you to the wikipedia page with A-Hon-Te-Ways. Though the phrase is a wikipedia's contributor's name, it is the only way you'll find it. That is the only wikipedia page with that name. The Ahontoay are a non federally recognized group of Chippewa's in Montana. The United States has no jurisdiction over them.   The only way to find out about this group of non treaty Chippewa's, is by using google or another search engine. Google Ahontoay and you will find that the name is spelt as Ahontoay. The wikipedia page spells it as Ahonteways, which is not the correct way of spelling the chiefs name on the historical records i have found on the internet. Don't get the two names Ahontoay and Ahonteways, mixed up. They are not two different peoples but the same people. Chief Ahontoay did not take treaty. He never lived on a Reservation which proves he refused to cooperate with the United States. You will have to deal with the obvious difference in name spelling.

False	Questions over status  As already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary IS a grey area.  I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the WPP.  If serving front line police officers are unsure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public.  I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent.  As a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality.  As it was, the article was subjective and questionable.  However these edits have been reverted without explanation ‚Äì apart from comments such as ‚Äòthis is the truth‚Äô.  In effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article.   London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‚Äòpolice constables‚Äô and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‚Äòany person‚Äô powers or as in the case of arrest, ‚Äòcitizen‚Äôs arrest‚Äô.    In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on‚Ä¶My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.  So the article started by saying, ‚ÄúWandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run‚Ä¶‚Äù.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‚Äòsuccessfully run‚Äô is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.  Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‚Äòpolice constables‚Äô but as ‚Äòparks constables‚Äô due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‚Äòcitizens arrest‚Äô.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers ‚Äì they don‚Äôt (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn‚Äôt do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (‚ÄúThey are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.‚Äù) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‚Äòpolice officer‚Äô.   I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‚Äòpolice‚Äô, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee‚Äôs results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion. NEWLI

If you had a NPOV on this dispute, then Machine Elf and Philogo would also be blocked (or better, nobody would be blocked, but the article would be locked on the current version). Clearly, this is not the case ... now why is that? By WP policy, a block cannot be punitive, only preventative, but this block changes nothing about the situation, so you are acting against your own policy! So, I challenge you, either block me (and thousands of other innocent potential contributors) indefinitely, for trying to improve an article that Machine Elf and Philogo clearly have control over, or try to resolve the issue in a more constructive manner (and I have already, several times, expressed my willingness to work through any specific issues relating to my edits of that article), but the current block serves no constructive purpose, and only escalates bad feelings ...

False	Template:Infobox former monarchy   Hi, Thumperward. The reason I reverted your edit is because there are dozens of articles using the template which do not have a specific value for the CoA width parameter, based on the assumption that the default width was 120px. When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.

During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:  ==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk)   The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.  The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.  I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)  Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:  ' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.  ' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

I have now consulted The Great Terror: A Reassessement , a  standard reference work and after a little searching found passages which support the generally accepted information which you deleted. See:  The '''Great Purge''' is the name given to the events of the late [[1930s]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when millions of people were arrested, about one million executed, and an estimated 12 million to sent to labour camps.  According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as """"anti-Soviet elements"""" among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (""""Yezhov storm""""). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.  It is rather obvious that you do not have a copy of this standard reference work available or choose not to refer to it. Furthermore you seem to be unfamiliar with generally accepted knowledge with respect to this area.

False	"""::I believe there was a lengthy study done by the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation & Enforcement Pittsburgh office and the State of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s which determined (1) extinguishing the fires was probably not technically feasible, and (2) it would cost more to try and extinguish the fires than it would to purchase all properties in the town. Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation. Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires.

False	That's a difficult question.  I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )  I think also we could go policy by policy, guideline by guideline, and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear.  What does it substantively accomplish.  That may not always be evident; it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why.  A history of how the policy was written could be interesting, but maybe not that helpful, and it would be difficult to summarize.  Just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies, the Village pump, or even user talk pages.

False	What if one of the magnets were removed(example the N) would the beam still split?  What if the beam started lower, if the beam, was closer the the S, would more mass go to the S, would there be a point, where it would not split anymore? How many people repeated this experiment? Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist. Radiation, has a direct effect on magnetism, and this experiment, needs to be redone, and explored.

False	"""  Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify.   I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a fa√ßon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). ‚Äî¬†Carl (¬†¬∑¬†talk) """

False	"""   Complex issue    This is quite a complex issue. There have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages (e.g. France, Greece, Quintana Roo in Mexico). I don't think these jurisdictions should be included in the template, since there is no generalised recognition of same-sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same-sex marriage. However, what we have in Alagoas seems a bit different. I am prima facie in favour of including Alagoas based on the reasoning of User:Denisxavier. However, before we include Alagoas, we need a bit more information about how Brazilian marriage law works. In particular, I have two questions:   *When an opposite-sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in Brazil, how do they do it? Are legal marriages registered at a Civil Registry Office, which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate? What is the role of the judge in these marriages? Also, what is a """"Notary""""? Are they a state official working in a Civil Registry Office, or a private person who can register marriages? The issue I am interested in here is: is the process for entering into a same-sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite-sex marriage in Alagoas? Or are there administrative / procedural differences?  *Are Civil Registry Offices/Notaries obliged to register same-sex marriages in Alagoas, or are they merely allowed to do so? If they are not obliged to do so, then I think it's more problematic to include Alagoas in the template, because it means that the law is not being applied consistently.   The fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant. When the Supreme Court of California legalised same-sex marriage in California, we still included it in the template, even if the Supreme Court of the US did not yet give its opinion. Wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities; if a superior court strikes down the lower court, then all we need to do is simply change the template again. This has been done a few times already. Cheers, '''''' ‚úâ """

False	""" No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else. Few facts: Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000.  Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls. Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing. Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011. In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% . All this means the following: The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.   Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling. However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas. And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk  We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """

False	Why did you delete the bulk of the West St.Paul and East St.Paul articles for likely copywright violation? Are you able to prove that the articles were in violation of a copywright? I didn't write the article but the original articles were actually quite good, and are now just a shell of their former selves. If you were certain the articles contained copywright vio why didn't you re-write them instead of just deleting everything?  Also, much of what you have written on the Winnipeg articles is incorrect, ie. Old Kildonan once being a part of East Kildonan (never was) and West Kildonan lying north of Inkster Blvd. (that was not the boundary), that Winnipeg's Mennonite population is 33,000 (not supported by statistics). Be sure that you are absolutely certain of the veracity of a fact and have done your research thoroughly before you write, add to, or edit an article. Otherwise readers will will receive misinformation and that is not what an encyclopaedia is intended for. The Winnipeg and city area articles are coming along quite nicely. Please don't delete any part of them for unsupportable reasons.
False	Your Ignorant Prejudice against the 10-string guitar  You clearly know very little about the repertoire of the 10-string guitar and as little about the difference between multi-string guitars and the type of guitar that Narciso Yepes invented (which is NOT simply a multi-stringed guitar or simply a 10-stringED guitar). It MUST be defined separately from multi-string guitars because of its primary characteristic and raison d'etre, which are characteristics NOT shared by other multi-string guitars. It belongs under Classical Guitar, and it deserves its own definition. Neither your ignorance nor your bias against Yepes nor your preference for your own favourite guitarists will stop the truth from coming out!  Also, please educate yourself as regards the repertoire for the 10-string guitar rather than claiming stupidly and falsely that no one of any significance but Ohana ever wrote music for 10-stringed guitars. You are not informing anyone, only showing your own bias and/or ignorance.  129.94.133.166

False	Negative POV ?

False	""" I'm sorry, I don't understand.  What is the """"it"""" that doesn't make what clear?  The statement that you have kept deleting says that Trent reaffirmed (affirmed again) the then existing teaching that Christian marriage is a sacrament.  The statement does make that clear.  If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You'd also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.  Isn't that obvious? As for the latest edit, which said that the Council of Trent reaffirmed the existing teaching only """"from their perspective"""", that is an utterly silly, unsourced, imaginative addition that contrasts with the clear decisive statement of the Fathers of the Council, who certainly wouldn't have dreamt of adding phrases such as """"from our perspective"""" to their clear reaffirmation of the existing teaching!

The answer is, because most would oppose it, but the anti-userbox admins think they know what is best, and are pulling every trick they can to cram this through.  If you want to design either a jury-pool process or a general election process to decide such things, I'll be happy to help you.  How is this a personal attack, except to note that the mass blanking happened and the perpetrator is documented?  Face it, the ban came only because what I said is unpopular with admins. MarkSweep made hundreds of blanking edits using admin tools, speciously twisted rules into knots and disrupted hundreds of users. He got a slap on the wrist, and polite applause.  I've received notes from admins on this page threatening me for suggesting that his actions constitute vandalism, which they clearly do.  I pass a note pointing this out to a small subset of the hundreds of users affected, I am banned for 31 hours.  How is this not political? Now I'm afraid to contact my own friends here, whom I know to be against this, but do not know about it.  Tacky? Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.  The fact is that this proposal will never have community assent because of its deep flaws, and I am resented for pointing this out.  Tacky is pretending in the face of all evidence that there is a basis for consensus here.

Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible.

I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying """"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article"""" would not have generated this negative discussion.

If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page.  Ebonics is not Black English, African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs.  If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.  But then, there would have to be historical linguistic evidence that Black Anglo Saxons brought Early Modern Black English, African American Vernacular English dialects to colonial America from somewhere in Germanic Europe.

Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?    The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181)  Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.    Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds"

False	Recent Edit  1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).  2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.  3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.  4. Added Sidhoji Rao Shithole's legal and proper name.

I am shamed and appalled by the policies enacted on this wiki and its BRUTAL suppression of dissenting opinions. And I am sickened by your grabs for power and glory by re-writing history and claiming sole credit for Wikipedia, when the truth is otherwise. Dr. Larry Sanger's claim to co-foundership here is more credible than your claims of sole credit, and no not because he's the doctorate holder and you're not. I believe him because he reads more to me in my judgment more authentic about his feelings and he's more a straight shooter than you.

What he reduced it to with his edit - with its bombastic egotistical patronising editing note - was weakly written, mushy, vague & illogical at points. Sorry if that's a bit tuff, but it's the truth. The Anglosphere is an increasingly important concept geo-strategically & it's important to get this source for the term right for those who search via Google for an explanation of it. I am open to edits, but they need to augment & improve the opening text, not reduce & state things that are not true, such as """"Eire being a part of the Anglosphere"""" - any1 with the slightest comprehension of the history of Ireland since 1916 can see the fallacy of this view, & whomever holds it does not grasp even the basics of what the Anglosphere actually is!  Plantdrew - Yr edit of the arms programme that militarily links the Anglosphere was useful & interesting, & I left it at 1st, even tho it didn't quite belong in the opening preamble of the article as it was a little too micro & not macro enough for an opening principle description, the reason I edited it out in my scrapping of """"Shuttegod's"""" massacring of the text is that it seemed to be antagonizing him, & it was out of place a little in the opening.

False	No problem, didn't want to move this conversation as I figured it would be wierd ) Well, first of all, if we look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Scream.jpg, and The Madonna etc, we see that several of these old pictures are in so-called public domain in The USA. And this being the American version of Wikipedia I would think that this link could be added as well. I noticed that the link-page which is on the Norwegian version of this Edvard Munch website, isn't in the English version, and this page cites books and websites as the sources of both images and text. Now, I can see that one may hesitate to link to a website like this, but if one were to deny every similar website (in other subjects/articles) to be linked to when the content is of such importance as it is here, Wikipedia wouldn't be much to look at -) You can find - probably thousands - of links of the same kind in all kinds of subjects and articles on Wikipedia. But as I said, I don't want to start an argument about this, I just think it's interesting to look into a case like this. What can and what can't be linked to... It's no big deal for me personally, but Wikipedia should set a standard and stick to it 100 percent. I just feel that the public should be able to see some other artworks of Edvard Munch than just The Scream and The Madonna... Especially when the artist has been dead for over 60 years (in regarding of copyright in several countries). Oh, well... Time for a cup of coffee -) ( )

Finally, because of the nice clean structure you made, it would be a very easy merge to accomplish. OK by you? -
False	The info I tried to include from these sources is almost fully available from various alternative press sources, as direct interviews with involved persons or as review from reporters on the case. The number of such interviews and other sources will doubtlessly grow with time. So, there's really no need to use the particular sources you fight against so much. But, at this moment my feeling is that the majority of active skeptics here just don't want a neutral article about the subject, and I feel I've really done my best for Wikipedia. Maybe I should give you some more time to evaluate the case and understand that your position is biased, so I don't have to fight an epic battle for each small info I include. Or maybe life will bring about more info on the case. In either case, my feeling is that you don't deserve more of my time and attention here for now. Thanks.

False	Baku was the home of the world's first oil well, the world's first paraffin factory, and the world's first oil platform. The city was once captured by Turkish troops in World War I, and afterwards by Bolsheviks. Along with the surrounding area, the city was incorporated into the Soviet Union.  During World War II the growing demand for oil pushed Baku oil workers to reach record levels of extraction‚Äî23,482 million tons. Baku entered a period of decline after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but has since recovered.
False	Salon.com is a news organization and should qualify under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NEWSORG. The Worldnetdaily article  is an editorial penned by Schlafly herself. It should be an RS for her words as quotation.  I want to know why you consider RightWingWatch to be unreliable. They are a news service, and their articles include the audio and direct quotes/transcripts of what they cover. While they have a bias (their purpose to fact-check and cover things in right wing media) that does not, per the RS page, make them unusable especially when they include their sourcing.
False	"""  My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library: Marco, Tom√°s (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century.  Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia The previous reference I had added‚ÄîRomero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaqu√≠n Turina (1882‚Äì1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1‚Äîis also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.   One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.   Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.   A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaqu√≠n Turina.   Hope that helps. Best,   """

False	This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.  This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled ‚ÄúCriticism‚Äù in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.  Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows   ‚Äúsingle source cited says it's not clear what even happened‚Äù I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk)  The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)    The complaint is based on five points  1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  ‚ÄúBiographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.‚Äù No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered.  2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. ‚Äúsingle sourced, anecdotal‚Äù, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator. 3/ Gwen Gale‚Äôs comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources. 4/ Gwen Gale‚Äôs comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia‚Äôs policy on Verifiability. 5/ Gwen Gale‚Äôs comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia‚Äôs Biography on Living Persons policy.  The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale‚Äôs conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.  Gwen Gale‚Äôs Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia‚Äôs Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia‚Äôs policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were ‚Äúanecdotal‚Äù, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle‚Äôs assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on

False	Results Summary/Elimination Chart Semi-final placements    On the elimination chart, I have replaced the 'adv' with other things that make more sense. 'Adv' is very vague. From the chart, I can gather that the top 3 voted contestants advanced. That is however not the case in reality. The top 3 females may have more votes that the top male but still the highest voted male, female and the next highest vote getter advanced. I have put a footnote at the bottom of the chart which says something along the lines of 'every week highest male, female and next highest advanced. Every week, 2 males advanced however it was never revealed which male was the highest and which male won the non-gender specific slot'... Because of this I have replaced 'adv' with 'Top 2' in the cyan colour for male contestants and 'Top' in pink for the female contestants that were non wild-card as we know that they were the highest female vote getters. This new format makes the chart much more correct especially with the footnote at the bottom.

False	Dating the exoudus  I added this over in the book of Joshua section and it has relavence here: There is now a theory postulated by Dr. Gerald E. Aardsma and Dr. Emmanuel Anati that states the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites occurred prior to the late Bronze Age as had been originally theorized. Doctors Aardsma and Anati say they have found evidence to support Joshua‚Äôs conquest occurring in the early Bronze Age at around 2200-2500 B.C. They state that both a settlement bearing topographical similarity to the biblical city of ‚ÄúAi‚Äù and the city of Jericho were destroyed in this time frame and that both sites had defensive walls at this time. In addition, it was found the city of ‚ÄúAi‚Äù was burned to the ground at this time, which fits the events in the Book of Joshua. Furthermore, it has been found that at this time the previous inhabitants of the areas around these cities gave way to a more nomadic people with different types of pottery than the original inhabitants and which developed into a pastoral society dominated by small villages. All of this would more accurately reflect what was recorded in the Biblical accounts of Joshua‚Äôs invasion, but it also conflicts with some of the Bible‚Äôs Old Testament chronology. Dr. Aardsma argues the Old Testament chronology must be an incorrect recording of the original chronological information.  This argument has a profound effect on dating the exodus since it would mean the Israelites would have left for Palestine just after the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, maybe even during its downfall. It would also push the age of the patriarchs back to about 2800-3000 B.C. which would mean any evidence of Joseph would need to be found in the Early Dynastic Period. I referenced Anati's article and Aardsman book over in the book of Joshua section. Last time I checked Anati's article was free to peruse online.

An Archaeological Assessment of Portions of the Red River Gorge, Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky.  Archaeological Report No. 1.  Lexington: Ohio Valley Archaeological Research Associates for U.S. Forest Service, 1977.  I have copied extensive amounts of text because no copyright notice is present ‚Äî it's a case of .      [page 33] Cowan's investigations at the Roger's Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).  [page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.  [page 50] This page notes that Cowan's 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered

False	"""==Name== I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?   I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.   there is a street in KJ called Sakmer  also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg  The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: ◊°◊ê◊ß◊û◊¢◊®. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.  I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.    It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.   I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing.   About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either.

They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.

It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.

I'll dial it back and post a note on the talk page, but ultimately I won't be watching it, so feel free to change it back if it becomes necessary.  As far as """"amount of vandalism"""" is concerned, here are my top indications that protection is needed (see also: WP:ROUGH):  Extreme vandalism (compare to the daily featured article, but generally > 5 unique IPs in 24 hours, or 3-4 unique IPs per day over a slightly longer period)  Sockpuppetry, if protecting the article is easier than an IP/rangeblock. (see Pioneer Courthouse Square for an extreme example of this)  BLP. This one is obvious. Especially for  Unsourced fancruft. Usually this is for articles that are continually getting edit-warred about the genre of a band, or the rumor that someone won the latest season of Survivor, or pretty much any article related to wrestling/MMA.  The squishy stuff: if an article is super-stable (compare diffs to 'cur', no productive changes over last 100 edits or N months) and the IPs never have anything to contribute. The last one is really the sticking point. In the recent history of Vanadium (just looking to the 20th or so), I see two repeat-offender IPs and a couple of random ones. The repeat-offenders should be warned and blocked for a short time if they haven't been blocked before. If it were (was) me, I'd feel comfortable semi-protecting the article for 3 days, *maybe* a week if I was frustrated. Finally, generally the semi-protection ramps up in length. So a common pattern I use is 3 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, then indefinite. Each time it should come unprotected and show big problems with IPs. As an aside, I didn't mean for this to be so long, and apologies if you know all of this. I tried to cast it as a personal opinion because it somewhat *is*.

False	RE: Deletion of 2004 Australian Election results   Galloglass, I understand your concerns. However, the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example (which is a historically important seat; oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard, who had held for the seat over 3 decades, and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce) so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable. The 2004 Election results remain on many multiple pages because no-one has updated these pages, and this is what I am striving to do.   If you feel that my actions are incorrect (which I can completely understand from your perspective), maybe you could create a new page (much like the one for Bennelong) and list the 2004 and earlier Election results here.

False	military equipment and tactics then?  It's hard to just talk about a weapon without talking about how it is used.    A three-level abstraction is required here.  We have the history and strategy which are inseparable, and should be discussed in articles on each war or conflict.  That's the most abstract.  Then we need the least abstract military equipment and tactics level, with articles like military technology during the Napoleonic wars and so forth, to make it clear how conflicts were conducted using this stuff - this should focus on the actual tactical combat engagements, how they affected outcomes, etc..  And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.  This gets into the mechanics of how things changed, how they thought, etc., and really isn't the same topic as either history/strategy or equipment/tactics for the guys on the ground using  the equipment to perform the tactics.
False	The main article is quite stubbish in terms of content - its the navigation boxes which are making articles too large - categories do this far more efficiently. I would much rather read a single article such as Crusaders (rugby) then have to read several articles on the one topic, with (of necessity) repeated background information in each. If the merge is rejected, then I would suggest a name change to either History of the Highlanders (rugby) or History of the Highlanders rugby franchise as being more appropriate, since Highlander is a relatively generic word.
False	My apologies   My statement was not appropriate and I apologize with high hopes that you will forgive me.
False	I pretty much agree. In fact I was just linking Kode9 because I saw the ref when reading the entry page and I know he has a page. Kode9 and Dubstep are certainly both notable, and the inspiration of Ballard is quite interesting, but is probably a good subject for a magazine article, not a Wikipedia one. Certainly, more POV than it should be. I think many good articles are spoiled by vainglorious mentions of friends' bands, so I can see where you are coming from. Wouldn't this suggest removing the whole para, though? If we are going to have the para referring to Kode9, surely it is right to link to his page?

False	"""  This page was subjected to repeated vandalism in the nature of a hoax. One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).  Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.    The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

False	"""  Manchus  In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".  Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.  My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""".   The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?    """

False	Money was a genius and an important influence on a number of academic disciplines, as well as on the arts in New Zealand and the US. At the same time, some of his ideas were clearly flawed, and - while he treated many patients who went on to happy and successful adult lives which might have been impossible without his influence - in at least two cases, his treatment proved disastrous. While this was certainly tragic, and Money must bear much responsibility for the failure of his theories, there is a need for a more balanced assessment of his career.

False	A personal Account of Cyclothymia   Dear Friends,   I'm still very unhappy about this Wikipedia page on Cyclothymia and I see that it has got even worse recently due to these copy-right problems. People will naturally be turning to Wikipedia as a first step to find out something about Cyclothymic Personality Disorder and they will be unaware of the controversies surrounding it e.g. that it is even disputed to be a personality disorder. http://s13.zetaboards.com/TheCollective/index/ and http://www.chatarea.com/TheCyclothymiaCollective appeared to have died since I last visited them so active discussion with other people who have been diagnosed or hope to be diagnosed is not presently possible, so let me offer this letter for the casual enquirer to read about the actual symptoms of somebody who has been diagnosed as Cyclothymic. The reader will note from the complaint above that I am unhappy that the main article does not contain any warning about such 'mixed state' Cyclothymia which frequently causes misdiagnosis as depression resulting in medication with anti-depressants which makes the condition worse. My attempt to rectify that state of affairs resulted in my contribution being removed, so I will not waste any time on making a new ammendment. Please be kind enough to leave this in the discussion though. The following is not for diagnostic purposes but solely to provide the enquirer with a taste of the sorts of symptoms that can be diagnosed as Cyclothymia. I was diagnosed 16 years after the onset of these symptoms, and this is a letter applying to volunteer to be the subject of some research conducted by my local university.  Dear Dr X,   I recently participated in the Beating Bipolar research, I was in the control group. I was handed a letter inviting me to participate in your research involving an MRI scan which intrigues me. I was intending to write this email several weeks ago but I put it off because I wanted to write you an account of what happens to me in my disorder that has been diagnosed as Cyclothymia. Since I am not getting around to writing you a longer account let me write you a short account, because I would very much like to be put in that MRI scan twice. Once I know that I am becoming hyperthymic ( hypomanic ) I can roughly predict when I am going to be hypothymic ( depressed ). This is because my cycles are extremely regular - given a distinct stress such as losing a job or starting a relationship I can mark out in advance on a calender when I will be high ( at end of the fifth week following ) and when I will be low ( at the end of the seventh week following ) and when I will come out on a level again ( at the end of the twelth week following ). I've always felt that the mechanical predictability of this should intrigue researchers, and I believe that what has happened to me is that the stress response mechanism has had its period reset. This first happened when I was 19 circa September 1981 and has continued ever since, but it took me until I was 25 to clearly identify that it was a cycle because it had disrupted my life so much. Originally I believed that I was dealing with the sort of kaleidoscope of problems that perhaps are typical of young people but having dealt with those problems with various counselling psychologies I was left facing a problem that could not be taken away. By the age of 35 I was chronically depressed because of the host of problems that came in its wake - unemployment, poverty, social isolation and depression - and my doctor at the time wrote me off onto Sick Benefit. This resulted in an interview with the Department of Social Security doctor who not only recognised that I was being discriminated against in employment but diagnosed me as having cyclothymia of a mixed state variety and recognised that doctors had kept interpretting my presenting symptoms as acute depression. I have since been moved onto Incapacity Benefit and have been monitored by a psychiatrist ever since, presently Dr X of the Community Mental Health Team in the X clinic.   I'd prefer to present this with diagrams, but it's not possible in an email - please feel free to draw your own !   The Basic Cycle   There is a stress event - a good example is a car crash that I was in with my partner at the time in which the car somersaulted down the ditch and yet we got out of it only bruised. She was shaking and very excitably upset at the time, couldn't sleep that night and the following day was tearful but then slept properly and was fairly normal the following day but wouldn't drive. She was bemused that I was so calm, arranged for help, drew a measured sketch map, slept well except for the bruises and drove us the 200 miles home. My own response to this stressful event was similar to hers only my excitable state came five weeks later and my depressed state seven weeks after the event. I was on a

The name is under dispute.     Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page   There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.    Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.    You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.    Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""". The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL. Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates. The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it. The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus). It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?      Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  """

False	"""   Vitamin B12   Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect. The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796  Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.  """"The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since. http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml """"Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980]. However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information. Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.  Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification.   your source however, didn't exactly say that B12 is produced by a unicelular alga.

False	Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!  I hope that I don't seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy for the following reason: It is the name of a film which you are promoting, and it appears that you are using two accounts simultaneously, this and . After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?  I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.  There are several options available to you:  We can talk about it, here.   You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.  Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.  If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.    ‚Äî'''''' (talk)

Originally there was one site given as a source for the Sonja de Lennart claims - www.sonjadelennart.com, a site owned by Eleonora de Lennart and created in February 2008.  A simple glance at this website will show that it is not a reputable source.  Instead, it was fabricated for the sole purpose of fooling Wikipedia. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia hoax was not detected before answers.com and other websites picked up the false claim of authorship and it was included in an Associated Press article that was widely syndicated.  The success of the hoax in tricking a reporter is now being used to give the hoax legitimacy.  Users Pchip and Delennart have had no other purpose on Wikipedia than to spread the false stories about Capri pants.  Your actions in supporting their claims and in blocking the attempt to undo their persistent vandalism are damaging Wikipedia.

And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_England#English_Civil_war long after the 16th.  Which made me wonder who started selling the book, and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult. As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War, which ended May of 1646, and the Second English Civil War. Naturally at the time 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration' was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War, but it might be considered slightly inflammatory.
