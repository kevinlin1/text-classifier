False	okay i see. you accused me of being one of them!
False	It was just pointed out (and I checked it in Guralnik's Careless Whisper)that Presley did indeed die whilst on the toilet.  If you feel it's important then add away.

False	Just dropping in to help you out. Your edit to the page Thin Lizzy are/were reverted following the guidelines set out in WP:CITE. You can't/shouldn't add anything that isn't NPOV or full of weasel words unless you can also provide a link citation to back up the edit. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Cheers!
False	Who ever said “everything that distinguishes the human line from the other great apes can be explained by a single event”? Certainly not me. All I’ve been doing is reacting to other editors who continually say there are better explanations than the AAH to explain human evolution. Alright, but what are these explanations? Whenever I ask I get nothing. And of course the AAH is falsifiable. You're getting confused because it's never been falsified (unlike the savanna theory, which has, and which proves that broad evolutionary theories can be).
False	I don't know why you haven't seen them, but I assure you there are. I have a couple of friends who are new to wikipedia and I told them to post and they say that there's no way to edit it at all.   And it seems to me by your previous post that you're not acting in wikipedia's best interests simply because of my behavior on my own user page. I certainly hope that's not the case here, but that's how it looks.   Furthermore, I was unaware that I'm not allowed to edit the content on my own user page. The reason I've blanked my content on there is because Trueblood keeps asking me questions and is really pissing me off, and instead of giving him a personal attack, I've chosen to ignore him. Instead he is reverting my page. Well, now I know I'm not allowed to change the content on my page, but I figure you might want to warn him not to revert everything I do simply because he doesn't agree with it. Because his harassment and his following me around and reverting me is really beginning to piss me off.
False	John discuss it here   Seems you don't like some edit that i made. Put it here. If you need we can discuss it.
False	Agreed, which is why I have not been removing the small portion of this article that could be considered well referenced. -
